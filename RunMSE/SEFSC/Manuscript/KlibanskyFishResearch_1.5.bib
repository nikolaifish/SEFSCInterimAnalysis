  abstract = {Spawning periodicities of white seabass (Atractoscion nobilis) were
	evaluated by observing spawning behavior, by collecting eggs, and
	monitoring recognizable sounds produced during the release of gametes.
	A total of 297 spawning events were documented from 15 male and 47
	female white seabass contained within the seminatural confines of
	a 526-m(3) net pen located in Catalina Harbor, Santa Catalina Island,
	California. Consistent spawning occurred from March through July
	2001-03, and peaked in May at a photoperiod of 14 hours. Most spawning
	occurred within the 2-hour period following sunset or from 19:00-20:00
	hours Pacific Standard Time. White seabass spawned at every phase
	of the lunar cycle; but an increase in successive spawning events
	followed the new moon. Most spawning occurred in water temperatures
	from 15 to 18 degrees C, and there was no apparent correlation with
	tidal cycles. Seasonal and diel spawning periods were directly correlated
	with increases in the rate, intensity, and variety of white seabass
	sounds; this correlation may indicate that sounds function to enhance
	reproductive success.' These findings can be extended to further
	develop seasonal fishery regulations and to better comprehend the
	role of sound in the reproduction of sound-producing fishes.},

	a long-lived species, reaching up to 40 years of age. They have isometric
	growth, although the alometric parameter b may vary throughout the
	year and in relation to latitude. Growth to age 3 is rapid compared
	to slower growth later in life. Phenomena of density dependent growth
	have been observed in the northeast Atlantic. Horse mackerel are
	an asynchronous species. The following stages of atresia have been
	validated in horse mackerel: alpha, beta, and delta. The transition
	in females from the spawning state to post spawning is very fast.
	The spawning fraction in horse mackerel is estimated to be between
	8.3% and 20.9%. Horse mackerel have a long spawning season (up to
	8 months), which varies according to geography. Length at first maturity
	is between 16 and 25 cm, most commonly around 21 cm. Males mature
	at a slightly smaller length than females. The age at first maturity
	for females has been estimated to range from 2 to 4 years, depending
	on the geography. Batch fecundity has been estimated to range between
	172-209 oocytes per gram-female-weight. Female spawning lasts between
	65 and 94 days. An individual female can release from 5 to 16 batches
	during the spawning period. The estimated potential annual relative
	fecundity ranges from 1040 to 3280 oocytes per gram-female-weight.},

	consequences are followed of assuming rapid declines in natural mortality
	rate M in the first few years of life to a low, constant adult natural
	mortality, as well as the observation, for small-mesh trawl cod ends,
	of declining availability with age. Several approaches are proposed
	for fitting declining M-with-age with a reciprocal function for hake,
	using criteria based on mean life-time fecundity, mean age at egg
	production, existing estimates of adult M, and vectors based on stock
	productivity assumptions. All vectors of M-at-age were similar to
	MSVPA estimates of North Sea stocks. The implications of the changes
	in mortality with age for stocks harvested by fine-mesh trawls were
	explored in yield per reemit calculations under 2 different hypotheses:
	1) using current estimates of growth and adult mortality, 2) M-at-age
	vectors for juveniles, dropping rapidly from age 0+, and declining
	availability to trawling for older fish. These hypotheses were compared
	within yield per recruit analyses. Under the new assumptions, given
	current F>>M (adults), yield isopleths predict no significant increases
	in Y/R with stretched mesh >40 mm, but a substantial decline in fecundity
	per recruit with small increases in effort by gill nets or longlines,
	aimed at mature fish. These results are linked to the refugium concept
	for older fish, and it is speculated that this may be in part responsible
	for the continued productivity of other sustained fisheries for juvenile

	captivity experiments and field samples, were classified ill this
	way. Water temperature in captivity tanks corresponded to high values
	(17-21 degrees C), except for one case in which different day and
	night temperatures were applied. In addition, 472 field samples (
	11948 anchovy females) from several cruises were examined: of these,
	126 samples (3348 females) were identified as coming from areas of
	hi h sea surface temperature (weighted mean =17.76 degrees C, s.d.=0.84)
	and 13 1 samples (3181 females) as, coming from areas of low sea
	Surface temperature (weighted mean =14.42 degrees C. s.d.=0.75).
	There was close agreement in the Succession of POF stages over time
	after spawning between the experiment and the field samples. The
	first four stages of POF degeneration occurred in less than 24 h,
	and by the end of the first day the POFs were mainly in Stage V.
	Stages VI and VII showed their highest occurrence during the first
	and second half of the second day after spawning, respectively. Full
	resorption of POFs was achieved in about 55-60 h. For the range of
	temperatures examined (13-19 degrees C), little effect of temperature
	oil the degeneration of POFs over time was noticed. The advanced
	degeneration stages were found all day round, showing some overlapping
	periods when Successive spawning cohorts co-occurred. The application
	of these results for ageing POFs is discussed.},

	conditions are restored after,a period of growth depression. CG reduces
	variance in size by causing growth trajectories to converge and is
	important to fisheries management, aquaculture and life history analysis
	because it can offset the effects of growth arrests. Compensatory
	growth has been demonstrated in both individually housed and grouped
	fish, typically after growth depression has been induced by complete
	or partial food deprivation. Partial, full and over-compensation
	have all been evoked in fish, although over-compensation has only
	been demonstrated when cycles of deprivation and satiation feeding
	have been imposed. Individually housed fish have shown that CG is
	partly a response to hyperphagia when rates of food consumption are
	significantly higher than those in fish that have not experienced
	growth depression. The severity of the growth depression increases
	the duration of the hyperphagic phase rather than maximum daily feeding
	rate. In many studies, growth efficiencies were higher during CG.
	Changes in metabolic rate and swimming activity have not been demonstrated
	yet to play a role. Periods of food deprivation induce changes in
	the storage reserves, particularly lipids, of fish. Apart from the
	strong evidence for the restoration of somatic growth trajectories,
	CG is a response to restore lipid levels. Although several neuro-peptides,
	including neuropeptide-Y, are probably involved in the control of
	appetite, their role and the such as growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like
	growth factor (IGF), role of hormones, in the hyperphagia associated
	with CG are still unclear. The advantages of CG probably relate to
	size dependencies of mortality, fecundity and diet that are characteristic
	of teleosts. These size dependencies favour a recovery from the effects
	of growth depression if environmental factors allow. High growth
	rates may also impose costs, including adverse effects on future
	development, growth. reproduction and swimming performance. Hyperphagia
	may lead to riskier behaviour in the presence of predators. CGs evolutionary
	consequences are largely unexplored. An understanding of why animals
	grow at rates below their physiological capacity, an evaluation of

	a histological approach to describe hermaphroditism, dynamics of

	Development of secondary growth follicles was asynchronous in all

	May and July. However, notable differences in sexual cycle and egg
	production were found. For the painted comber, hydrated follicles
	were present in ovarian tissue almost every day during the peak of
	the spawning season, suggesting daily spawning and increasing the
	chances of autofertilization unless a mechanism to avoid this action
	is present in this species. Intersexual Mediterranean rainbow wrasses

	consider life-history variation, little is known about how various
	reproductive strategies affect stock dynamics. Protogynous (female-to-male)
	sex change is a relatively common life history pattern in fishes
	for which standard assessment methods do not exist. We developed
	a stock-assessment model for a commercially and recreationally exploited
	sex-changing species [California sheephead, Semicossyphus pulcher
	(Ayres, 1854)] to determine how ignoring or including sex change
	affects the assessment of the stock. First, we demonstrated that
	ignoring sex change leads to an overestimate of spawning biomass
	and very different conclusions regarding the effect of exploitation
	on the spawning potential ratio (SPR). Furthermore, we found that
	the stock assessment is highly uncertain (current SPR estimates range
	from 0.08 to 0.6) because we do not know how male depletion affects
	reproduction or what determines individual and population variation
	in the size of sex change. Our results demonstrate that, although
	incorporating sex change into stock-assessment models is important,

	knowledge of vital rates such as survival, growth, and reproduction.
	However, these variables are influenced by individual behavior, and
	when managing exploited populations, it is now generally realized
	that knowledge of a species' behavior and life history strategies
	is required. However, predicting and understanding a response to
	novel conditions-such as increased fishing-induced mortality, changes
	in environmental conditions, or specific management strategies-also
	require knowing the endogenous or exogenous cues that induce phenotypic
	changes and knowing whether these behaviors and life history patterns
	are plastic. Although a wide variety of patterns of sex change have
	been observed in the wild, it is not known how the specific sex-change
	rule and cues that induce sex change affect stock dynamics. Using
	an individual based model, we examined the effect of the sex-change
	rule on the predicted stock dynamics, the effect of mating group
	size, and the performance of traditional spawning-per-recruit (SPR)
	measures in a protogynous stock. We considered four different patterns
	of sex change in which the probability of sex change is determined
	by 1) the absolute size of the individual, 2) the relative length
	of individuals at the mating site, 3) the frequency of smaller individuals
	at the mating site, and 4) expected reproductive success. All four
	patterns of sex change have distinct stock dynamics. Although each
	sex-change rule leads to the prediction that the stock will be sensitive
	to the size-selective fishing pattern and may crash if too many reproductive
	size classes are fished, the performance of traditional spawning-per-recruit
	measures, the fishing pattern that leads to the greatest yield, and
	the effect of mating group size all differ distinctly for the four
	sex-change rules. These results indicate that the management of individual
	species requires knowledge of whether sex change occurs, as well

	variation in direct female benefits between matings. We further demonstrate

	developments have come from the extension of the surveys to more
	species and areas, an increasing interest in evaluating time-series
	of reproductive potential in stocks, and the needs for research and
	development in support of marine aquaculture. A growing number of
	studies on field-caught and captive fish since the 1990s have led
	to important advances in our understanding of the triggering of maturation
	and gametogenesis, the subsequent processes of oocyte (follicle)
	growth and vitellogenesis, regulation of fecundity through atresia,
	batch spawning dynamics, and the influence of extrinsic factors such
	as day length, temperature and feeding. We conclude that the biological
	basis for egg production survey methods is now extremely well established
	for the main species being surveyed. However, the extension of the
	methods to a wider range of species ha; highlighted the practical
	difficulties in obtaining sufficiently precise and unbiased estimates
	of key parameters such as spawning fraction or sex ratio that are
	influenced by spatial distribution or catchability of several population
	components (e.g. mature, immature active spawning or spent). The
	definition and validation of spawning markers also remains a challenge,
	particularly for new species being surveyed. Given the often high
	cost of egg production surveys, particularly the annual method, there
	is a need for simulation studies to determine the relative performance
	of simpler and less expensive approaches to tracking SSB from egg
	surveys for use in stock assessment. Developments that expand the
	quantity and utility of the information yielded by the surveys, including
	integration of the surveys into broader ecosystem studies, could
	also be considered a way to improve cost-effectiveness.},

	to late-September 1997 at two small patch reefs in Hawaii. Our objectives
	were to elucidate daily timing of spawning in relation to water temperature,

	occurred every 5-7 days at both reefs, with all spawning on a reef
	concluded either within a single day (1-day spawning) or within two
	successive days (2-day spawning). Spawning began in early morning
	and continued for most of the day. There was a significant, positive
	linear relationship between mean daily average water temperature
	(= daily average temperature averaged over the period starting from
	the day following the last spawning day of the preceding nest cycle
	till the day before the first spawning day of the current cycle)
	and peak spawning hour of day, for 1-day spawning, and the first
	and second days of 2-day spawning at both reefs. The relationship

	of day was comparable among all spawning-day classes and reefs. Hatching
	occurred on the fourth day of development throughout the study despite
	the 26.5-29.1degreesC change in water temperature during the study
	period, and hatching was restricted to within two hours after sunset.
	We propose that D. albisella's peak spawning time is positively correlated
	with increased water temperature because it maintains the benefits
	of synchronous spawning within two constraints: the narrow daily
	period of hatching, and the inverse relationship between water temperature

	highlight some fundamental problems with the apparently more quantitative
	approaches (i.e. ‘bulk’ methods measuring biomass or volume of
	each prey type) and suggest that frequency of occurrence (%F) provides
	the most robust and interpretable measure of diet composition. The
	additional information provided by bulk methods contains unquantifiable
	and potentially significant error from a variety of sources. In our
	experience, the contents of most guts cannot be unambiguously separated

	unidentifiable and inseparable partially digested material. Even
	where separation is possible, the composition of a gut at one point
	in time is affected by many unquantifiable factors unrelated to the
	actual composition of the diet. Consequently, bulk methods provide
	ambiguous interpretations from superficially quantitative models.
	Where research questions require more detail, these problems mean
	there is little alternative to time-consuming approaches like prey
	reconstruction. However, for the descriptions of dietary composition
	presented in many studies, %F provides robust data that overcome
	many of the limitations of the more detailed approaches and provides

	per se, by growth and survival. To make up for this shortcoming,

  volume = {60},

  abstract = {The existence of adaptive phenotypic plasticity demands that we study
	the evolution of reaction norms, rather than just the evolution of
	fixed traits. This approach requires the examination of functional
	relationships among traits not only in a single environment but across
	environments and between traits and plasticity itself. In this study,
	I examined the interplay of plasticity and local adaptation of offspring
	size in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Guppies respond
	to food restriction by growing and reproducing less but also by producing
	larger offspring. This plastic difference in offspring size is of
	the same order of magnitude as evolved genetic differences among
	populations. Larger offspring sizes are thought to have evolved as
	an adaptation to the competitive environment faced by newborn guppies
	in some environments. If plastic responses to maternal food limitation
	can achieve the same fitness benefit, then why has guppy offspring
	size evolved at all? To explore this question, I examined the plastic
	response to food level of females from two natural populations that
	experience different selective environments. My goals were to examine
	whether the plastic responses to food level varied between populations,
	test the consequences of maternal manipulation of offspring size
	for offspring fitness, and assess whether costs of plasticity exist
	that could account for the evolution of mean offspring size across
	populations. In each population, full-sib sisters were exposed to
	either a low- or high-food treatment. Females from both populations
	produced larger, leaner offspring in response to food limitation.
	However, the population that was thought to have a history of selection
	for larger offspring was less plastic in its investment per offspring
	in response to maternal mass, maternal food level, and fecundity
	than the population under selection for small offspring size. To
	test the consequences of maternal manipulation of offspring size
	for offspring fitness, I raised the offspring of low- and high-food
	mothers in either low- or high-food environments. No maternal effects
	were detected at high food levels, supporting the prediction that
	mothers should increase fecundity rather than offspring size in noncompetitive
	environments. For offspring raised under low food levels, maternal
	effects on juvenile size and male size at maturity varied significantly
	between populations, reflecting their initial differences in maternal
	manipulation of offspring size; nevertheless, in both populations,
	increased investment per offspring increased offspring fitness. Several
	correlates of plasticity in investment per offspring that could affect
	the evolution of offspring size in guppies were identified. Under
	low-food conditions, mothers from more plastic families invested
	more in future reproduction and less in their own soma. Similarly,
	offspring from more plastic families were smaller as juveniles and
	female offspring reproduced earlier. These correlations suggest that
	a fixed, high level of investment per offspring might be favored
	over a plastic response in a chronically low-resource environment
	or in an environment that selects for lower reproductive effort.},

	To do so we used data from nine years of daily egg production method,
	DEPM, surveys, carried out in the Strait of Sicily. The spatial distribution
	and occurrence of actively spawning individuals were also analysed.
	Results showed that the actively spawning phase period (ASPP), i.e.,
	the period from the onset of oocyte hydration to spawning ranged
	approximately 4.5 h between ca. 18:30 and 23:00 while a daily spawning
	peak was identified at 22:30. The sex ratio was skewed during the
	ASPP such that females exceeded males by ca. 20% at mid ASPP. During
	the ASPP the proportion of Day-0 females (i.e., females that spawned
	or would spawn the day of sampling) decreases with increasing bottom
	depth while outside the ASPP Day-0 spawners did not show any particular
	bathymetric pattern. In the study area, anchovies exhibit segregative
	spawning behaviour which drives spawners to select shallower waters,
	similar to other anchovy populations in the Mediterranean while in
	the Atlantic and in other clupeoid populations the opposite bathymetric
	trend has been observed.},

	developed to explore the effects of trap spacing, density, and agonistic
	behaviour at the trap shows that, in the absence of agonistic interactions
	at the trap (i.e., trap saturation), catch rates conform to those
	expected from the conceptual model, provided that trap exposure modifies
	the catchability at all traps equally. Trap saturation reduces the
	effect of trap interactions, particularly at high densities, and
	causes the relationship between capture probability and distance
	from the trap to depend on density. We discuss the application of
	the model to trap-by-trap data in practice and conclude that the
	approach may be valuable in an experimental context when direct methods

	Ground-feeding finches on continents may also be more vulnerable

	within many fish populations, fisheries are commonly managed across
	large spatial scales that aggregate interacting sub-populations into
	single management units. Such mis-match between the ecological and
	management scales may lead to a loss of spatial diversity and a restricted
	ability of populations to adapt and persist in the presence of changing
	environmental conditions. Developing harvest strategies for spatially
	complex fish populations therefore remains a major challenge. In
	this study, we evaluate whether managing spatially complex fish stocks
	as large-scale aggregates leads to greater conservation risks. We
	develop a closed-loop simulation model that represents a range of
	dispersal scenarios and includes imperfect management knowledge about
	the abundances and dynamics of interacting Pacific herring (Clupea
	pallasi) sub-populations, as well as weak management control of how
	exploitation is allocated among sub-populations. The latter is driven
	by the spatial dynamics of the fishing fleet as it seeks to optimize
	profitability. Simulated management outcomes did not always lead
	to increased risks under all scenarios of dispersal, fishery spatial
	dynamics, and management errors. Instead, these processes interacted
	to either mediate or intensify the impact of inappropriate management
	assumptions and stock assessment errors. Management strategies aimed
	directly at limiting exploitation risk consistently protected spatially
	complex populations in the presence of incorrect management assumptions
	about stock structure, high fishing power, and persistent stock assessment
	errors. Given the pervasiveness of these errors in fisheries, we
	recommend further evaluation of spatio-temporal refugia for tactical
	management of spatially complex fish populations.},

	growth rates and influences life history decisions, such as age and

	a statistical model of length at age, abiotic factors such as area
	and year of capture explained more of the variance than biotic factors

	in a southward direction and was higher for cod captured offshore
	than for those captured inshore. In a statistical model of the proportion

	attained 50% maturity (M-50) more than a year younger than Northeast

	more than did an equal increment in the size of males. Reproductive
	success of males decreased with size, because females preferred smaller
	males. At the same time, large males won contests for access to females,

	body size and embryo size existed. Predictably, in mate choice experiments

	a consequence of both natural selection (fecundity increases with
	size in females but not in males) and sexual selection (males prefer
	larger females). We argue that sexual size dimorphism did not evolve
	by selection minimizing overlap in food niches between the sexes,
	because food production is high in the Zostera beds where the fishes
	live, and no size dimorphism was found in the sympatrically occurring
	S. typhle. Furthermore, in N. ophidion dimorphism is not greater

	typhle egg size and the average number of eggs transferred per spawning
	were positively correlated with female body size. Apparently more
	energy per offspring was provided by larger males than by smaller
	males, and larger males also carried more offspring. As predicted,
	large mates were preferred by both sexes in mate choice experiments.
	This is explicable in terms of both natural selection (fecundity
	increases with size in both sexes) and sexual selection (both sexes
	prefer large mates). As a consequence of selection acting in the
	same direction in both sexes, sexual dimorphism is absent in S. typhle.},

	two decades with examples of their use worldwide. It provides a review
	on whether EPMs have fulfilled their objectives. Given their increased
	utilisation on new fish stocks, and their contribution to scientific
	advances, EPMs continue to be useful. However, concerns about the
	bias and precision of the methods remain, and a continuous effort
	to improve those issues together with the cost-efficiency of the

	are the major evolutionary forces that select for larger body size

	for large body size is eventually counterbalanced by opposing selective
	forces. While the evidence for selection favoring larger body size
	is overwhelming, counterbalancing selection favoring small body size
	is often masked by the good condition of the larger organism and
	is therefore less obvious. The suggested costs of large size are:
	(1) viability costs in juveniles due to long development and/or fast
	growth; (2) viability costs in adults and juveniles due to predation,
	parasitism, or starvation because of reduced agility, increased detectability,
	higher energy requirements, heat stress, and/or intrinsic costs of
	reproduction; (3) decreased mating success of large males due to
	reduced agility and/or high energy requirements; and (4) decreased
	reproductive success of large females and males due to late reproduction.
	A review of the literature indicates a substantial lack of empirical
	evidence for these various mechanisms and highlights the need for
	experimental studies that specifically address the fitness costs
	of being large at the ecological, physiological, and genetic levels.
	Specifically, theoretical investigations and comprehensive case studies
	of particular model species are needed to elucidate whether sporadic
	selection in time and space is sufficient to counterbalance perpetual

  abstract = {Background: The preservation of fish egg quality after ovulation-control
	protocols is a major issue for the development of specific biotechnological
	processes (e.g. nuclear transfer). Depending on the species, it is
	often necessary to control the timing of ovulation or induce the
	ovulatory process. The hormonal or photoperiodic control of ovulation
	can induce specific egg quality defects that have been thoroughly
	studied. In contrast, the impact on the egg transcriptome as a result
	of these manipulations has received far less attention. Furthermore,
	the relationship between the mRNA abundance of maternally-inherited
	mRNAs and the developmental potential of the egg has never benefited
	from genome-wide studies. Thus, the present study aimed at studying
	the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) egg transcriptome after natural
	or controlled ovulation using 9152-cDNA microarrays. Results: The
	analysis of egg transcriptome after natural or controlled ovulation
	led to the identification of 26 genes. The expression patterns of
	17 of those genes were monitored by real-time PCR. We observed that
	the control of ovulation by both hormonal induction and photoperiod
	manipulation induced significant changes in the egg mRNA abundance
	of specific genes. A dramatic increase of Apolipoprotein CI (APOCI)
	and tyrosine protein kinase HCK was observed in the eggs when a hormonal
	induction of ovulation was performed. In addition, both microarray
	and real-time PCR analyses showed that prohibitin 2 (PHB2) egg mRNA
	abundance was negatively correlated with developmental success. Conclusion:
	First, we showed, for the first time in fish, that the control of
	ovulation using either a hormonal induction or a manipulated photoperiod
	can induce differences in the egg mRNA abundance of specific genes.
	While the impact of these modifications on subsequent embryonic development
	is unknown, our observations clearly show that the egg transcriptome
	is affected by an artificial induction of ovulation. Second, we showed
	that the egg mRNA abundance of prohibitin 2 was reflective of the
	developmental potential of the egg. Finally, the identity and ontology
	of identified genes provided significant hints that could result
	in a better understanding of the mechanisms associated with each
	type of ovulation control (i.e. hormonal, photoperiodic), and in
	the identification of conserved mechanisms triggering the loss of
	egg developmental potential.},

	Oocytes were measured using a micrometric ocular scale and classified
	by diameter and morphological characteristics; absolute fecundity
	was established as the total number of hydrated oocytes per ovary.
	The studied population exhibits a repetitive spawning strategy, given
	the coexistence of post-ovullatory follicles and hydrated oocytes
	in histological sections and the presence in ripe ovaries of an intermediate
	cohort of yolked oocytes ready for hydration. Individual fecundity
	is lower (1422 +/- 422 oocytes/ovary) than in other puyen populations,
	but the egg production increases through individual repetitive spawnings
	during the protracted spawning period (from October to February).
	Females attain larger sizes than those of other South American populations
	(the largest female reaching 115 mm total length), maximizing its
	potential fecundity. The present paper contributes to the knowledge

	of fishery yields and productivity. Furthermore, because the incidence
	of deep-water coral was also logged in the surveys, we explored the
	relationship between coral, which provides habitat for groundfish,
	and catch levels. We found that abundances were highest where coral
	was present. Finally, we conducted meta-analyses of the importance
	of marine foundation species, such as corals, kelps, seagrasses,
	and oyster reefs, in promoting the diversity and abundance of associated
	taxa and found that diversity was 1.4-fold higher and abundances
	were 3.4-fold higher where these habitat-forming species were present.
	Together, these results suggest that biodiversity and the presence
	of foundation species can serve as useful indicators of a marine
	ecosystem's ability to provide the goods, services, and functions
	that we and other orgranisms rely, on. We therefore suggest that

	larvae in coastal Newfoundland waters were consistent with passive

	of high production. Recently hatched larvae from pelagic spawners
	decreased in size throughout the spawning season, reflecting seasonal
	decreases in egg diameter. Larvae from demersal eggs increased in

	growth. Lloyd's index of patchiness calculated for pelagic eggs generally

	decreased after hatch, then increased at approximately 10 mm. We
	hypothesize that the observed spatial patterns in older larvae, seasonal
	size increases in larvae from demersal eggs, and ontogenetic changes
	in patchiness reflect active processes. Predator patchiness, ontogenetic
	changes in spatial patterns, and published larval consumption rates
	support the hypothesis that mortality did not generate this pattern.
	Furthermore, mean crowding of capelin larvae by potential prey increased

  abstract = {The striped trumpeter, Latris lineata, is a pelagic marine fish found
	in southern Australia that is currently being developed as an aquaculture
	species. Striped trumpeters are multiple spawners with group synchronous
	oocyte development and spawn in the wild from late winter to early
	spring. By shifting light and temperature regimes, it is possible
	to manipulate broodstock to spawn in captivity outside of their normal
	ambient season. Broodstock condition, egg morphology and biochemistry
	were examined over a spawning season for three groups of broodstock
	held under ambient or photothermal-manipulated (PTM) conditions.
	Using a Torry Fish Fatmeter the muscle fat of male and female striped
	trumpeter broodstock held under ambient conditions was found to decrease
	over a season by 25% and 40%, respectively. Five general trends were
	observed in eggs spawned during both ambient and PTM seasons. First,
	overall egg volume remained unchanged. Second, the egg oil droplet
	volumes decreased to <80% of those measured at the start of the spawning
	season. Third, there was a decrease in the triacylglycerol (TAG)
	fraction of egg total lipid and a concomitant increase in the proportion
	of polar lipid (PL). Fourth, the relative proportions of egg monounsaturated
	fatty acids (MUFA) decreased over a breeding season, probably as
	they were depleted because of the energy requirements of vitellogenesis.
	Fifth, proportions of the essential fatty acids (EFA), 20:4n-6 (arachidonic
	acid, ARA), 20:5n-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA) and 22:6n-3 (docosahexaenoic
	acid, DHA) was typical of marine fish eggs (1.8%, 10.1 % and 20.9%
	of total fatty acids, respectively), and remained unchanged or were
	elevated in eggs over a season. Data suggest that holding broodstock
	under PTM or ambient conditions results in similar temporal changes
	in egg biochemistry, albeit more truncated during the PTM season.
	Despite ongoing feeding by striped trumpeter during spawning, the
	total energetic cost of vitellogenesis results in a depletion of
	lipid in the muscle that is in turn reflected in egg biochemistry.
	Finally fatty acid requirements for striped trumpeter larvae determined
	during the live feeding period are not too dissimilar from average
	egg fatty acid profiles, supporting the theory that egg values can
	provide a basis for estimating dietary requirements. (C) 2007 Elsevier

  abstract = {Scientific fisheries surveys routinely identify a large diversity
	of commercial and non-commercial benthic megainvertebrates that could
	provide useful information for Marine Strategy Framework Directive
	(MSFD) descriptors. Species is obviously the basic taxonomic level
	to which most ecological studies and theories refer. Identification
	at this level of organization is indeed always preferred over any
	other taxonomic level. Nevertheless, aggregation of species to higher
	taxonomic levels may be unavoidable sometimes, since errors of identification
	are known or suspected to occur in many surveys. Using analyses of
	taxonomic sufficiency (identification of organisms at various taxonomic
	resolutions) and groups of morphospecies (taxa identified easily
	by non-experts on the basis of evident morphological traits), this
	study aims to quantify the loss of ecological information incurred
	by partial identification of benthic megafauna in bottom trawl surveys
	in order to put such data to good use. The analyses were conducted
	on five scientific surveys representing a large range of geographical
	areas (from 150 km(2) to 150 000 km(2)) and environmental conditions.
	Results show that genus, family and, particularly, morphospecies
	are good surrogates for species identification in community analyses.
	We suggest that bottom trawl surveys can provide reliable megafauna
	data that may usefully complete those obtained by grab surveys. The
	use of morphospecies could lead to new strategies, combining different
	datasets to provide indicators for MSFD descriptors (e.g. D6). (c)

	from fish landed by commercial fishing vessels at English ports on
	a monthly basis since 1983. A comparison was made with maturity estimates
	for sole derived from research vessel survey data. The market sampling
	data were summarized using general linear modelling and used to generate
	maturity ogives for sole. There are a number of uncertainties with
	this approach, stemming from the use of the commercial fishery to
	provide the fish samples and reliance on visual (macroscopic) staging
	to ascertain the stage of sexual maturation of the gonads. Despite
	the inability to resolve all uncertainties, it was felt that it should
	be feasible to derive,,e general-purpose maturity ogives from market
	sampling data, and that these should be sufficiently reliable for
	use in assessing the spawning stock biomass of North Sea Dover sole.
	Male and female sole were shown to have different growth and reproductive
	strategies, with the emphasis being directed towards maximizing egg
	production. Current stock assessments for sole assume that sexual
	maturation is knife-edged, with all fish maturing at 3 years of age.
	Evidence is presented to show that this approach is likely to inflate
	estimates of spawning stock size, since not all 3-year-olds spawn.
	and the proportion that do spawn varies annually, Size selection
	pressures resulting from commercial fishing practices are also likely
	to further inflate estimates of the spawning stock size. In addition
	reproductive investment in first time spawning females was found
	to be substantially lower than in older established spawners, and
	it is the latter which are the first to become depleted through the

	L.), whiting (Merlangius merlangus L.), saithe (Pollachius virens
	L.) and Norway pout (Trisopterus esmarkii Nilsson). The fish were
	caught at a site south-east of Shetland in late spring during 24
	h depth-stratified fishing using a mid-water trawl. There was overlap
	in the range of prey consumed by the various species. Fish of 1-3
	cm in length fed mainly on copepods and other invertebrates. Larger
	Norway pout continued to feed almost entirely on copepods, but the
	other species diversified as they grew to include fish in their diet,
	cod and whiting becoming almost entirely piscivorous. Haddock and
	saithe ate moderate amounts of fish combined with crustacea in roughly
	equal proportions. The depth at which the fish were caught did not
	appear to influence the range of prey consumed, but fish was slightly
	more prevalent in the diet of 0-groups caught near the surface. The
	results indicate that a food web of increasing complexity can develop
	during a relatively short time scale in late spring when the 0-group
	gadoids are pelagic. Generalised linear modelling revealed diel feeding
	patterns which were size-dependent and species-specific. In 2-3 cm
	cod, for example, peak feeding was during the period 1200-2000 h
	and high numbers of prey (mainly invertebrates) were consumed, The
	stomachs of the larger cod (3-5 cm) contained smaller numbers of
	mainly fish prey and peak feeding switched to 0000-0800 h. The piscivorous
	0-groups were capable of eating relatively large prey items, providing
	the opportunity for larger individuals to eat younger or slower-growing
	individuals from the same year class. Whiting in particular were
	subject to substantial levels of cannibalism and inter-specific predation,
	Feeding interactions of this sort might be of sufficient magnitude
	to influence significantly the survival and recruitment of gadoids.
	High fecundity in whiting, coupled with multiple spawnings over a
	protracted period of time means that offspring from late spawnings
	could act as a food reserve for siblings from earlier spawnings.
	Such prey provide substantially more energy than the female invested
	in producing the original egg from which the prey was derived. This
	mechanism could prove to be an energy-efficient way of providing
	food reserves for the early offspring. It is also an efficient way
	of governing population size through density-dependent mortality.

	The theoretical optimal harvest comes from removing the age-class

	is derived from considering the sensitivity of equilibrium egg production
	to harvest using results for density-dependent Leslie matrices. The
	method holds in both single- and multi-site contexts and is derived
	for both Ricker and Beverton-Holt recruitment functions. I illustrate
	the method for a one-site model of Arcto-Norwegian cod (Gadus morhua)
	and obtain the same optimal strategy as previous methods, namely
	that age-class 6 should be harvested 45%. Including age-specific
	selectivities, the best constrained yields occur at a harvest rate
	of 11% on ages 5-12. This yield is 73% of the theoretical optimum.
	I considered the same model when a reserve is established and found
	that high transfer rates out of the reserve (where spawners attain
	a higher fecundity) produced greater yields that were 86% of the
	one-site (no reserve) yield. Also, if overfishing occurs at 1.5 and
	2.0 times the optimal level in the one-site case, then most yields

	Canaveral, FL), the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Ft. Myers to Crystal
	River, FL), the north-central Gulf of Mexico (Destin, FL, to Chandeleur

	contained both postovulatory follicles (POF) and oocytes in final
	oocyte maturation (FOM) during all months of the reproductive season.
	Batch fecundity was calculated by using three different methods:
	oocytes >700 pm were fixed in 1) Gilson's fixative or 2) 10% neutral
	buffered formalin (NBF), and 3)oocytes undergoing FOM were sectioned

	method showed a positive relationship with fork length (P=0.021,
	r(2)=0.132) and ovary-free body weight (OFBW; P=0.016, r(2)=0.143).

	comparisons across its range are not available. We evaluated aspects
	of female spotted seatrout reproduction in five estuaries ranging

	temperature profiles were similar among the five estuaries, but spring
	salinities were lower in Apalachicola Bay, FL (AFL) and St. Louis

	in CHFL, Barataria Bay, LA (LA) and TX (range 16.6-31.7parts per

	five months in MS and AFL, six months in LA and TX, and seven months
	in CHFL. Peak gonodosomatic index (GSI) values varied from May to
	July among estuaries. The smallest sexually mature females captured
	ranged from 235 mm TL in LA to 285 mm TL in AFL. Mean relative batch
	fecundity (# eggs g(-1) ovary-free body weight) was significantly
	higher (ANOVA, p < 0.5) in TX (390 +/- 39) and LA (397 +/- 26) than

	of females in the late developing ovarian class with postovulatory
	follicles, ranged from 4.2 to 7.7 d and was not significantly different
	when all months were combined. However, significant differences during
	March, April and September (&chi;(2), p < 0.01) showed that spotted
	seatrout from CHFL and AFL spawned less frequently than those from
	other estuaries. Overall, MS and AFL fish have the shortest reproductive
	season, fewer number of spawns and appear to obtain sexual maturity
	at a slightly larger size. Five hypotheses to explain these differences
	are presented: variations in time of sampling, temperature, habitat

	the number of gonadal classification schemes and terms. This has
	made it difficult for both scientists and resource managers to communicate
	and for comparisons to be made among studies. We propose the adoption
	of a simple, universal terminology for the phases in the reproductive
	cycle, which can be applied to all male and female elasmobranch and
	teleost fishes. These phases were chosen because they define key
	milestones in the reproductive cycle; the phases include immature,
	developing, spawning capable, regressing, and regenerating. Although
	the temporal sequence of events during gamete development in each
	phase may vary among species, each phase has specific histological
	and physiological markers and is conceptually universal. The immature
	phase can occur only once. The developing phase signals entry into
	the gonadotropin-dependent stage of oogenesis and spermatogenesis
	and ultimately results in gonadal growth. The spawning capable phase
	includes (1) those fish with gamete development that is sufficiently
	advanced to allow for spawning within the current reproductive cycle
	and (2) batch-spawning females that show signs of previous spawns
	(i.e., postovulatory follicle complex) and that are also capable
	of additional spawns during the current cycle. Within the spawning
	capable phase, an actively spawning subphase is defined that corresponds
	to hydration and ovulation in females and spermiation in males. The
	regressing phase indicates completion of the reproductive cycle and,
	for many fish, completion of the spawning season. Fish in the regenerating
	phase are sexually mature but reproductively inactive. Species-specific
	histological criteria or classes can be incorporated within each
	of the universal phases, allowing for more specific divisions (subphases)
	while preserving the overall reproductive terminology for comparative
	purposes. This terminology can easily be modified for fishes with
	alternate reproductive strategies, such as hermaphrodites (addition
	of a transition phase) and livebearers (addition of a gestation phase).},

	anthropogenically driven productivity but also was sensitive to geographical/climatic
	factors. Thus, warmer and shallower lower-altitude European lakes,
	which are usually more eutrophic, had higher fish densities than
	cold and deeper higher-altitude lakes. Fish size increased with altitude
	and declined with increasing seasonality and temperature. * After

	species' reproductive biology throughout its geographical distribution.
	Red snapper were sampled in 1999 and 2000 from commercial fishery
	catches taken on Campeche Bank at depths ranging from 43 to 130 m.
	Overall sex ratio (male : female) and sex ratios by size-class did
	not differ significantly from a 1:1 ratio. First maturity was at
	a slightly smaller size in males (24.2 cm total length [TL]) than
	in females (28.3 cm TL), and maximum length percentages at first
	maturity were 28% for males and 34% for females. The length at which
	maturity was attained in 50% of females (L50) was 31.4 cm TL. The
	Campeche Bank red snapper stock had a protracted spawning period
	from February to November, with a spawning peak occurring in early
	fall. Vitellogenic oocytes were continually recruited from previtellogenic
	oocytes during the entire spawning season, with no gap between each
	oocyte development stage. This means that red snapper ovaries are
	asynchronous and that the species can be considered a heterochronal
	(batch) spawner with indeterminate annual fecundity. Females in spawning
	condition were collected from both the northeastern and northwestern
	areas of Campeche Bank, near submerged or emergent coral reef structures,
	and at depths between 48 and 117 m. These results generally agreed
	with those for red snapper stocks in others regions of the Gulf of
	Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean off the southeastern United States.
	However, reproductive periodicity in the Campeche Bank red snapper
	stock apparently displayed more of an insular pattern of extended
	spawning in comparison with the typical continental pattern of restricted
	spawning reported for other regions. The latitudinal differences
	observed in red snapper spawning seasons could also reflect a latitudinal
	gradient in the intensity of seasonal environmental constraints.},

  abstract = {Herring (Clupea harengus) is a capital breeder that stores energy
	reserves in muscle tissue. Individual potential fecundity relies
	on the size and weight of female fish. Poor condition during the
	maturation process can lead to a heavy down-regulation of fecundity
	through atresia and, in the extreme, cause skipped spawning. Herring
	in the Central Baltic Sea exist in a variable environment where food
	availability fluctuates substantially. Compared to other herring
	populations their condition is generally poor. In the present study,
	the oocyte dynamics and fecundity in relation to the condition of
	Central Baltic herring was investigated. A modern stereological method,
	the physical fractionator, was used to quantify the number of oocytes
	in previtellogenic (PG), cortical alveoli (CA) as well as successive
	vitellogenic (VT1 and VT2) stages in central Baltic herring during
	ovarian maturation. The potential fecundity, i.e. the number of VT2
	oocytes, was low compared to other Atlantic stocks but the relative
	potential fecundity was higher. The latter decreased by 71% when
	comparing early-maturing individuals with CA oocytes and late-maturing
	individuals with VT2 oocytes, suggesting a substantial down-regulation
	of fecundity. Although determined as spring spawners by otolith hatch
	type, 15% of the randomly sampled females were characterized by oocytes
	in CA stage in the prespawning period, indicating skipped spawning.
	The condition of these females was poor, which might have resulted
	in skipped spawning. Ovary weight was a good predictor of potential
	fecundity within maturing stages of females. Combined with estimates
	of skipped spawning, this ovary weight could be used to estimate
	egg production thereby improving Central Baltic herring stock-recruitment

	fecundity of Lake Michigan bloater Coregonus hoyi during December

	This trade-off can influence several life-history patterns, including
	when, for organisms that grow after maturity, allocation to gonads
	begins following the previous reproductive event. White crappie Pomoxis
	annularis, a spring-spawning freshwater fish, began allocating energy
	to ovaries in autumn at the expense of continued somatic growth and
	higher potential fecundity. Within five populations, the amount of
	early allocation varied between years. We combined dynamic programming
	with an individual-based model to determine how summer and spring
	feeding conditions interact to influence when allocation to reproduction
	should begin. Model results indicated that autumn allocation to ovaries
	was in response to future spring feeding conditions rather than recent
	summer feeding conditions. At least a 10% probability of poor spring
	feeding conditions resulted in ovary investment patterns that matched
	field observations. The model was unable to explain the inter-annual
	variation in autumn energy observed in the field. Early allocation
	of energy to ovaries is probably an evolutionary adaptation to the

	to be an inherent characteristic of reproduction; peaks in mean daily
	egg production, female gonado-somatic index (I(G)) and the fraction
	of females with eggs were observed at the full moon of each sampled
	month. An increase in the fraction of late-stage vitellogenic oocytes
	within the ovaries was also observed at the full moon. Reproductive
	effort peaked in the late spring and summer as indicated by high
	values of mean daily egg production, female I(G) and the recorded
	incidence of females spawning for at least two consecutive days.
	Mean daily egg production and I(G) of monthly samples were lowest
	in November to February, although some level of egg production continued
	throughout the year. Large individual variation in batch fecundity
	was observed, with a range from 44 to > 24 000 eggs per female produced
	on a single sampling date. Smaller females, 80-120 mm standard length
	(L(S)), produced limited numbers of eggs, while females >= 120 mm
	L(S) were capable of maximal egg production (> 20 000 eggs per batch).
	In contrast to trends observed in many fish species, no significant

	lunar cycles, in the design of reproductive studies of multiple-spawning
	fishes. Greater insight into the environmental factors that regulate

  abstract = {A field comparison of baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS)
	and prawn (shrimp) trawls was made to assess the sampling options
	for describing patterns of fish biodiversity in the lagoonal waters
	of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Replicated comparisons were
	made during the day and night on trawl grounds with different biophysical
	characteristics. Each trawl was made close and parallel to a long-shore
	set of five BRUVS set at regular intervals along one nautical mile.
	For each species, the sum of the maximum number of fish sighted on
	BRUVS at any one time (SigmaMaxN(1, ..., 5)) was compared with the
	number of fish caught in trawls (N). The two techniques recorded
	significantly different components of the fish fauna on the trawl
	grounds. Trawls caught mainly small (less than or equal to 300 mm),
	sedentary or cryptic, demersal species-such as flatfishes, apogonids,
	synodontids, triglids and callionymids. The BRUVS recorded more larger,
	mobile species from a much wider size range of families, including
	large elasmobranchs, more fusiform pelagic species (such as carangids
	and scombrids), and numerous eels. Species accumulation curves were
	parallel and very similar in shape for both techniques, but were
	separated by about 11 extra species in trawls. Fifty-two species
	in 17 families were caught only in trawls and 38 species in 15 families
	were recorded only by BRUVS. The occurrence of 38 small mobile species
	in 21 families was common to both techniques, but most of these showed
	marked differences in relative abundance. Trawls recorded higher
	species richness at all sites, and at night, but the average number
	of species and individuals recorded per transect were only about
	26% and 19% lower for the BRUVS. The BRUVS consistently recorded
	more species during the day than trawls, and are limited most by
	water clarity. Multivariate analyses showed that both techniques
	indicated the presence of six fish assemblages based on day and night
	in three locations, despite sampling quite different components of
	the fauna. The six assemblages accounted for 78.9% of the variation
	in the BRUVS data compared to 68.9% of the variation in the trawl
	data, and there was a lower error rate in discriminating the six
	assemblages in the BRUVS data. BRUVS are non-extractive and can be
	used on complex topographies and in sensitive habitats in most or
	all zones of the Marine Park, but models of bait plumes are needed
	to convert fish sightings to density estimates. They may have a particular
	role in studies of larger, rarer elasmobranchs and teleosts of special
	conservation interest. Trawls can be used in any level of water clarity
	and provide direct estimates of fish density, particularly those
	smaller teleosts most vulnerable to the effects of trawling. The
	complementary use of prawn trawls and BRUVS would enable a more comprehensive
	assessment of teleost and elasmobranch diversity in the variety of
	inter-reef seabed topographies and management zones comprising the
	Marine Park. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

	we test these two fundamental assumptions, using three closely related
	species of crickets, Gryllus firmus, G. veletis, and G. pennsylvanicus.
	Egg weight, 35-day fecundity and 35-day egg biomass were estimated
	in a population of each species, and the relationships between these
	reproductive traits and date of egg laying and body size were estimated.
	The relationships between egg weight and offspring survival were
	also sought for eggs buried at different depths, soil moistures,
	and soil types (G. firmus and G. veletis), as well as in the field
	(G. pennsylvanicus). A trade-off between egg weight and 35-day fecundity
	was revealed in a multivariate analysis taking into account among-species
	variation in egg weight and body size. Independent of the environmental
	conditions affecting the eggs, a positive correlation existed between
	the number of larvae that emerged from the soil and propagule weight
	in each species. Therefore, these findings provide partial support
	for the assumptions considered in the models mentioned above. A single
	optimal egg size was favored in two out of the three sets of conditions
	in which the functions relating egg weight to larval survival could
	be derived. The conditions encountered by the eggs, however, influenced
	the average survival of the larvae, as well as the shape of the relationship
	between egg weight and offspring survival. This suggests that cricket
	eggs frequently face heterogeneous environments with respect to egg
	and hatchling survival; the implication of habitat heterogeneity
	on the evolution of an optimal egg size is considered. The relationships
	between the reproductive components and female age and size, as well
	as between egg size and variation in cricket life-history, are discussed

	20 degrees S) and southern Chile (Talcahuano, 36 degrees S) and throughout

	(eggs per batch per female) and relative fecundity (eggs per female
	weight) were lower off Talcahuano during the peak spawning months.
	Thus, larger eggs spawned in the southern population seem to be produced
	at the cost of a reduction in fecundity. The eggs also differed biochemically
	between the 2 populations; total lipids and triacylglycerides were
	much higher off Talcahuano. The biochemical composition (both populations)
	also changed throughout the spawning season, with higher lipids early
	in the spawning season (July to August) off Talcahuano. Hatching
	success decreased during the spawning season, and correlated positively
	with egg size and lipid contents. Environmental conditions differed

	Off Talcahuano, the temperature and winter-time water column productivity

	The widespread occurrence of sexual dimorphism in life history traits
	and the occurrence of skewed and fluctuating sex ratios suggest that
	one-sex models or those dominated by one sex may often be less appropriate
	than two-sex models. Reproduction in two-sex models is a frequency-dependent
	nonlinear function (the birth or marriage function) of the relative
	abundance of males and females. In this paper, we examine the population
	dynamics resulting from three different two-sex, discrete-time, population-projection
	models. For a large class of birth functions, models without inter-stage
	mate competition are shown to converge to a locally stable adult
	sex ratio. Formulas for the stable population structure, stable sex
	ratio, and reproductive value at equilibrium are derived. When individuals
	of different stages compete for mates, the equilibrium population
	structure may become unstable. A sequence of bifurcations then occurs,
	leading to periodic oscillations, quasi-periodic fluctuations, and
	chaos as the intensity of competition increases. Finally, when per
	capita fecundity is a sigmoid function of the relative abundance
	of the other sex, perturbations of the sex ratio may lead to extinction.},

	We can multiply RE, often measured in fractions of adult body mass
	committed to reproduction per unit time, by the average adult life
	span to get lifetime reproductive effort (LRE). Williams's hypothesis
	(across species, RE decreases as life span increases) can then be
	refined to read "LRE will be approximately constant for similar organisms."
	Here we show that LRE is a key component of fitness in nongrowing
	populations, and thus its value is central to understanding life-history
	evolution. We then develop metabolic life-history theory to predict
	that LRE ought to be approximately 1.4 across organisms despite extreme
	differences in production and growth rates. We estimate LRE for mammals
	and lizards that differ in growth and production by five-to tenfold.
	The distributions are approximately normal with means of 1.43 and
	1.41 for lizards and mammals, respectively (95% confidence intervals:

	The sustainability of ray populations is of concern to fisheries

	We investigated the population genetic structure of thornback rays
	from 14 locations in the southern North Sea, English Channel and
	Irish Sea. Adults comprised < 4% of the total sampling despite heavy
	sampling effort over 47 hauls; thus our results apply mainly to sexually

	population differentiation was detected with a global F-ST = 0.013

	Although earlier tagging studies suggest restricted foraging distances
	from home areas, the absence of genetic differentiation between some
	distant populations suggests that a substantial fraction of individuals
	migrate over wide areas. Autumn/winter locations appear to have a
	lower level of differentiation than spring/summer, which could be
	due to seasonal migration. Management and conservation of thornback

	to body mass and temperature in post-larval teleost fish. The resulting
	database comprised 138 studies of 69 species (representing 28 families
	and 12 orders) living over a temperature range of c. 40 degreeC.
	2. Resting metabolic rate (Rb; mmol oxygen gas h-1) was related to
	body mass (M; wet mass, g) by Rb = aMb, where a is a constant and
	b the scaling exponent. The model was fitted by least squares linear
	regression after logarithmic transformation of both variables. The
	mean value of scaling exponent, b, for the 69 individual species
	was 0.79 (SE 0.11). The general equation for all teleost fish was
	lnRb = 0.80(lnM) - 5.43. 3. The relationship between resting oxygen
	consumption and environmental temperature for a 50-g fish was curvilinear.
	A typical tropical fish at 30degreeC requires approximately six times
	as much oxygen for resting metabolism as does a polar fish at 0degreeC.
	This relationship could be fitted by several statistical models,
	of which the Arrhenius model is probably the most appropriate. The
	Arrhenius model for the resting metabolism of 69 species of teleost
	fish, corrected to a standard body mass of 50 g, was lnRb = 15.7
	- 5.02.T-1, where T is absolute temperature (103 X K). 4. The Arrhenius
	model fitted to all 69 species exhibited a lower thermal sensitivity
	of resting metabolism (mean Q10 = 1.83 over the range 0-30degreeC)
	than typical within-species acclimation studies (median Q10 = 2.40,
	n = 14). This suggests that evolutionary adaptation has reduced the
	overall thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism across species.
	Analysis of covariance indicated that the relationships between resting
	metabolic rate and temperature for various taxa (orders) showed similar
	slopes but significantly different mean rates. 5. Analysis of the
	data for perciform fish provided no support for metabolic cold adaptation
	(the hypothesis that polar fish show a resting metabolic rate higher
	thanpredicted from the overall rate/temperature relationship established
	for temperate and tropical species). 6. Taxonomic variation in mean
	resting metabolic rate showed no relationship to phylogeny, although
	the robustness of this conclusion is constrained by our limited knowledge
	of fish evolutionary history.},

  abstract = {In immature and adult females of protogynous gobies, small distinctive
	masses of cells associated with the ovarian wall develop into testis-associated
	glandular structures during sex change. These precursive accessory
	gonadal structures, or pAGS, have been found in females of known
	protogynous goby species, but not among gonochoric goby species,
	suggesting that their presence can be used as a species-specific
	indicator of protogyny within the family. However, a detailed examination
	of a developmental series of ovaries in two gonochoric species, Gobiosoma
	illecebrosum and G. saucrum, revealed the presence of a gonodal feature
	previously thought to be restricted to protogynous gobies. Among
	immature females of both species, pAGS-like structures having a similar
	appearance and placement as functional pAGS of protogynous gobies
	were found. In female G. illecebrosum, the size of these structures
	among immatures progressively decreased with maturation and were
	absent in all but the smallest adult females. A similar pattern was
	evident in a small sample of G. saucrum. Population demography based
	on field collections showed that G. illecebrosum exhibits sex ratios
	and male and female size-frequency distributions typical of gonochores
	and laboratory experiments indicated that final sexual identity was
	unaffected by social environment during the juvenile period. Thus,
	the presence of pAGS in juvenile female G. illecebrosum is not related
	to an ability to change sex at that ontogenic interval. Whether the
	transient pAGS observed here are vestiges of an ancestral protogynous
	condition is unknown. Based on their presence among immatures in
	two gonochore gobies, however, only the presence of pAGS in adult
	females should be used to predict protogyny among gobies.},

	occurring at the southern end of Long Island were investigated during
	the winters of 1987-1988 and 1988-1989. Fish aggregate at two specific
	sites around the time of the full moon in December and January, possibly
	not during November and almost certainly not during February. At
	one site the fish aggregate well inside the shelf edge while at the
	other they are on the dropoff into deep water. Fish migrate, probably
	as distinct groups of up to about 500 individuals, to the sites on
	or before the full moon and remain for several days. There was no
	significant difference in the size of males and females caught from
	the aggregations between years or months. Female/male sex ratio was
	between 5 : 1 and 3 : 1. Courtship occurred in late afternoon with
	spawning commencing shortly before sunset. Most spawning occurred
	within 10 min of sunset. Water temperatures were 25.0-25.5-degrees-C
	during a period of gradual decrease towards the annual minimum in
	February and March. Two color patterns were important in courtship
	and spawning. The 'bicolor' pattern is a submissive coloration indicating
	a non-agressive state acquired by both males and females near the
	time of spawning. The 'dark' phase is acquired by females who are
	followed by numerous bicolor fish during courtship and they lead
	spawning events in this pattern. Spawning occurred among subgroups
	of the aggregation numbering 3-25 fish; gamete release was well above
	the bottom. Drogues deployed with the gametes either moved inshore
	or did not move far away from the shelf edge over the course of several
	days. Nassau groupers may not strictly be protogynous hermaphrodites
	and other groupers which form spawning aggregations may not be so
	either. Latitudinal shifts in spawning time may be related to water
	temperatures. Currents at aggregation sites do not appear to favor
	offshore transport of eggs. Questions of whether spawning aggregations
	should be protected need to be answered.},

  abstract = {In ecology and conservation biology, the number of species counted
	in a biodiversity study is a key metric but is usually a biased underestimate
	of total species richness because many rare species are not detected.
	Moreover, comparing species richness among sites or samples is a
	statistical challenge because the observed number of species is sensitive
	to the number of individuals counted or the area sampled. For individual-based
	data, we treat a single, empirical sample of species abundances from
	an investigator-defined species assemblage or community as a reference
	point for two estimation objectives under two sampling models: estimating
	the expected number of species (and its unconditional variance) in
	a random sample of (i) a smaller number of individuals (multinomial
	model) or a smaller area sampled (Poisson model) and (ii) a larger
	number of individuals or a larger area sampled. For sample-based
	incidence (presence-absence) data, under a Bernoulli product model,
	we treat a single set of species incidence frequencies as the reference
	point to estimate richness for smaller and larger numbers of sampling
	units. The first objective is a problem in interpolation that we
	address with classical rarefaction (multinomial model) and Coleman
	rarefaction (Poisson model) for individual-based data and with sample-based
	rarefaction (Bernoulli product model) for incidence frequencies.
	The second is a problem in extrapolation that we address with sampling-theoretic
	predictors for the number of species in a larger sample (multinomial
	model), a larger area (Poisson model) or a larger number of sampling
	units (Bernoulli product model), based on an estimate of asymptotic
	species richness. Although published methods exist for many of these
	objectives, we bring them together here with some new estimators
	under a unified statistical and notational framework. This novel
	integration of mathematically distinct approaches allowed us to link
	interpolated (rarefaction) curves and extrapolated curves to plot
	a unified species accumulation curve for empirical examples. We provide
	new, unconditional variance estimators for classical, individual-based
	rarefaction and for Coleman rarefaction, long missing from the toolkit
	of biodiversity measurement. We illustrate these methods with datasets
	for tropical beetles, tropical trees and tropical ants. Surprisingly,
	for all datasets we examined, the interpolation (rarefaction) curve
	and the extrapolation curve meet smoothly at the reference sample,
	yielding a single curve. Moreover, curves representing 95% confidence
	intervals for interpolated and extrapolated richness estimates also
	meet smoothly, allowing rigorous statistical comparison of samples
	not only for rarefaction but also for extrapolated richness values.
	The confidence intervals widen as the extrapolation moves further
	beyond the reference sample, but the method gives reasonable results
	for extrapolations up to about double or triple the original abundance
	or area of the reference sample. We found that the multinomial and
	Poisson models produced indistinguishable results, in units of estimated
	species, for all estimators and datasets. For sample-based abundance
	data, which allows the comparison of all three models, the Bernoulli
	product model generally yields lower richness estimates for rarefied
	data than either the multinomial or the Poisson models because of
	the ubiquity of non-random spatial distributions in nature.},

	inventories need to be designed around the use of effective sampling
	and estimation procedures, especially for 'hyperdiverse' groups of
	terrestrial organisms, such as arthropods, nematodes, fungi, and
	microorganisms. The challenge of estimating patterns of species richness
	from samples can be separated into (i) the problem of estimating
	local species richness, and (ii) the problem of estimating the distinctness,
	or complementarity, of species assemblages. These concepts apply
	on a wide range of spatial, temporal, and functional scales. Local
	richness can be estimated by extrapolating species accumulation curves,
	fitting parametric distributions of relative abundance, or using
	non-parametric techniques based on the distribution of individuals
	among species or of species among samples. We present several of
	these methods and examine their effectiveness for an example data
	set. We present a simple measure of complementarity, with some biogeographic
	examples, and outline the difficult problem of estimating complementarity
	from samples. Finally, we discuss the importance of using 'reference'
	sites (or sub-sites) to assess the true richness and composition
	of species assemblages, to measure ecologically significant ratios
	between unrelated taxa, to measure taxon/sub-taxon (hierarchical)
	ratios, and to 'calibrate' standardized sampling methods. This information
	can then be applied to the rapid, approximate assessment of species
	richness and faunal or floral composition at 'comparative' sites.},

	identify minimum sets of 10-min squares that represented at least
	10-30% of the regional abundance of each species under constraints
	for degree of spatial aggregation among sites. Numbers of non-exploited
	species in these sites, and species represented at abundance levels
	equal to or greater than the targets set for juveniles of economically
	important species were identified, and both were compared with mean
	totals from 100 sets of randomly drawn squares of equivalent number

	Inherent variability due to energetic and environmental constraints

	In this study, we assessed how size-dependent reproductive timing
	interacts with age truncation to impact estimates of SRP in spotted
	seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), using a combination of modeling techniques.
	Positive size dependence in spawning frequency, or the number of
	spawning events in a season, had a substantial impact on both the
	SRP and estimates of stock status relative to management targets.
	The loss of the oldest age classes, even under relatively low fishing
	pressures, resulted in a significant decline in SRP due to the disproportionately
	large contribution by these age classes. Not surprisingly, the effect
	increased with the strength of the size-dependent relationship, which
	also resulted in reducing the proportionality between SRP and spawning
	stock biomass (SSB). The potential for erroneously classifying the
	health of a stock was amplified when the population approached the
	management target because of the uncertainty and inherent variability
	in SRP. For management, characterizing all of the size-dependent
	relationships with SRP (batch fecundity, reproductive timing, egg/larval
	quality) may be more critical than obtaining precise estimates of
	SRP when management reference points are relative to unexploited

	(SSS) approaches are outlined, each developed to mimic the Depletion-Based
	Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) estimation of overfishing limits
	(OFLs) currently applied to data-limited U.S. west coast groundfish
	species. SSS-MC uses Monte Carlo draws of natural mortality, steepness,
	and stock depletion and estimates initial recruitment, while SSS-MCMC
	estimates natural mortality, steepness, and initial recruitment while
	fitting to an artificial abundance survey representing stock depletion
	with an error distribution equivalent to the stock depletion prior
	used in DB-SRA. These approaches are applied to 45 species of unassessed
	groundfishes in the Pacific Fishery Management Council Groundfish
	Fishery Management Plan, and the OFL estimates are compared to corresponding
	DB-SRA estimates. Despite model structure and parameter specification
	differences, SSS led to results comparable to DB-SRA over a wide
	range of species and life histories. SSS models with sex-specific
	life history parameters and growth variability are also presented
	as examples of how the inherent flexibility of SS can be used to
	account for more uncertainty in derived quantities. SSS-MCMC, while
	exhibiting statistically undesirable traits due to the inclusion
	of the artificial survey, readily includes data-informed abundance
	surveys into an assessment framework consistent with more complex,
	data-informed assessments. Establishment of viable data-limited approaches
	in SS is a convenient first steps in "building-up" stock assessments
	towards fuller implementation in SS when additional data become available,
	while also providing a way to inform management in data-limited situations.

	of stock status, which is a difficult task when population and fisheries
	data are limited. Three simple metrics based on catch length compositions
	(i.e., that reflect exclusive take of mature individuals, P(mat);
	that consist primarily of fish of optimal size, the size at which
	the highest yield from a cohort occurs, P(opt); and that demonstrate
	the conservation of large, mature individuals, P(mega)) can be used
	to monitor population status relative to exploitation. The metrics
	(collectively referred to as P(x)) were intended to avoid growth
	and recruitment overfishing, but there was no quantitative linkage
	to stock status and calculation of future sustainable catches. We
	attempt to make this connection by exploring the relationship of
	P(x) measures to fishing mortality and spawning biomass (SB). The
	relationships are compared specifically to the current target reference
	point (0.4 times the virgin, or unfished, SB [SB(0)]) and limit reference
	point (0.25SB(0)) used for the U.S. West Coast groundfish fishery
	by using simulations based on a deterministic age-structured population
	dynamics model. Sensitivity to fishery selectivity, life history
	traits, and recruitment compensation (steepness) is explored. Each
	P(x) measure showed a wide range of possible values depending on
	fishery selectivity, steepness, and the ratio of the length at maturity
	(L(mat)) to the optimal fishing length (L(opt)). Although the values
	of P(x) may be compatible with sustainable fishing, these values
	are not always sufficient to ensure stock protection from overfishing.
	Moreover, values for P(x) cannot be interpreted adequately without
	knowledge of the selectivity pattern. A new measure, P(obj) (the
	sum of P(mat), P(opt), and P(mega)), is introduced to distinguish
	selectivity patterns and construct a decision tree for development
	of stock status indicators. Heuristic indicator values are presented
	to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Although several caveats
	remain, this approach builds on the recommendations of previous literature
	by giving further guidance related to interpreting catch length composition
	data under variable fishery conditions without collecting additional
	information. It also provides a link to developing harvest control
	rules that inform proactive fisheries management under data-limited

	Furthermore, as, on both coasts, the length of the smallest male
	was greater than that at which all females had become mature, B.
	frenchii is a monandric protogynous hermaphrodite, i.e. all of its
	males are derived from functional females. Attainment of maturity
	by females is related more to length than age, whereas the reverse
	is true for sex change. On the basis of Schnute growth equations
	and length-to-body mass regression equations, the predicted length
	at age and body mass at length of fish on the south coast were greater
	than those on the west coast throughout life. Although B. frenchii
	spawns daily during the main spawning season, which extends from

	migration guided by habitat preference in the intertidal snail Littorina
	saxatilis in a hybrid zone associated with an ecotone across the

	we found evidence for this behavior in one of the two locations studied.
	Second, we made reciprocal transplants to suppress the phenotypic
	gradient observed across the hybrid zone and measured the relative
	contributions of selection and migration to its regeneration. Selection
	played an important role at the two locations studied, but migration
	was only important at one, where it accounted for between a third
	and a half of the regenerated gradient. This overall minor effect
	of migration was relevant for theoretical models dealing with nonallopatric
	speciation, because it suggested that variation for habitat preference
	did not have an important role in the initiation of the differentiation
	process. The preference behavior observed in the hybrid zone would
	have evolved secondarily, as a consequence of habitat-dependent fitness

	peak delayed as compared with first-time spawners. The condition

	tend to present better and wider condition than smaller females,
	the condition of females seems to be delayed in larger females probably
	mediated by the seasonal pattern in food availability. This "energy
	storage strategy" in spring and summer time seems to be size-dependent
	and past energetic reserves could also affect the egg production
	and timing of reproduction. We concluded that the reproductive season

	advantage of producing large eggs against the fitness cost of producing
	few eggs. Consequently if offspring fitness is relatively lower at
	a given egg size in one environment than another, the optimal egg
	size should be relatively larger in the harsher environment. We investigated
	this prediction at eight permanent lakes in Algonquin Park, Ontario.
	We analyzed differences in egg size with a three-level nested analysis
	of variance at the levels of treatment (lakes with and without fish),
	lake, and clutch. We found no significant difference in treatment
	means, and, therefore, the hypothesis was not supported. There was
	no significant variance component due to lake of origin, but there
	was a highly significant variance component attributed to the clutch

	GOOGLE (and me) TRANSLATION Previous research of A. Pasquali and I
	(1941) led to the demonstration that in sea bream (Sparus auratus
	L.) male and female germ areas, geographically separated from the
	earliest days of the differentiation of the gonad bisexual, develop
	and mature at different times, so it determines a protandric hermaphroditism
	with a phase maturational initial male followed by a phase maturational
	female. This was the first clear definition of course of sexual differentiation
	of gonads in the teleost, for which previously was known only (Syrski,
	Brock, Hoek) that presented a proterandrico hermaphroditism, according
	to some constant, others not. Most were still uncertain our knowledge
	on the sexual behavior of related species in the snapper, including
	once in the one family of Sparidae, then dismembered by some authors
	in order of most families related Percomorphi. As in other species
	had been found to be more or less established cases of hermaphroditism
	beside unisexuality, I thought it appropriate to undertake the study
	of sexual differentiation of the various species of Sparidae our
	seas with the primary purpose of seeing how it goes from the lower
	Vertebrates hermaphroditism to gonochorism or vice versa, depending
	on whether you should consider the primary condition first or second.
	
	
	ORIGINAL Precedentí ricerche di A. Pasquali e mie (1941) hanno portato
	alla dimostrazione che nell orata (Sparus auratus L.) le aree germinali
	maschile e femminile, separate topograficamente fin dai primi tempi
	del differenziamento della gonade bisessuale, si sviluppano e maturano
	in tempi diversi; per cui si determina un ermafroditismo proterandrico
	con una fase maturativa iniziale maschile seguita da una fase maturativa
	femminile. Era questa la prima precisa definizione del decorso del
	differenziamento della gonade dell’attivitá sessuale in questo
	teleosteo, per il quale in precedenza si sapeva soltanto (Syrski,
	Brock, Hoek) che presentava un ermafroditismo proterandrico, secondo
	alcuni costante, secondo altri no. Píu incerte ancora erano le nostre
	conoscenze sul comportamento sessuale delle specie affini al l’orata,
	comprese un tempo nell’unica famiglia degli Sparidae, successivamente
	smembrata da alcuni autori in piú famiglie affini dell’ordine
	dei Percomorphi. Poiché anche in altre specie erano stati riscontrati
	casi piú o meno constati di ermafroditismo accanto a casi di unisessualitá,
	ritenni conveniente intraprendere lo studio del differenziamento
	sessuale delle varie specie di Sparidi dei nostri mari con lo scopo
	precipuo di vedere come nei Vertebrati inferiori si passa dal l’ermafroditismo
	al gonocorismo o viceversa, a seconda se si debba considerare condizione
	primaria il primo o il secondo.},

	lecithotrophy, where the developing embryo solely depends on its
	yolk reserves; or 2. matrotrophy, where the maternal organism supplies
	nutrients to the developing embryo throughout gestation. Many chondrichthyan
	fish that are lecithotrophic, produce eggs similar in size to those
	of other egg layers, but some produce extremely large eggs, 10 cm
	in diameter. Production of huge eggs presents physical and physiological
	challenges, namely, providing the egg with massive amounts of yolk
	and other materials required by the developing embryo, and that of
	maintaining its integrity before and after ovulation. In most eggs,
	simple villar projections from the follicle cells traverse the egg
	envelope and come in close proximity to the egg, producing the striated
	appearance of the zona radiata. In large shark eggs, however, there
	are extremely long, (50-60 µm) actin-based, branched, villar processes
	that physically connect the follicle cells directly to the egg. These
	radial processes appear to be a complex transport network. As the
	egg increases in size, the egg envelope narrows considerably and
	the actin-based processes form a tangential meshwork around the egg,
	similar to the radial framework in a car tire. At the time of ovulation,
	the actin network in the egg envelope would serve as a flexible supporting
	structure to maintain cellular integrity.},

  abstract = {The process of model selection includes making an assumption about
	the distribution of ‘errors’ about the mean response. Generalized
	linear models (GLMs) offer considerable flexibility in this regard.
	However, graphical methods for identifying potential error distributions
	can fail to discriminate among sets of candidate error distributions.
	I examine an information-theoretic approach to this issue, which
	ranks candidate models (error distributions) using Akaike's information
	criterion (AIC). I evaluate the effectiveness of this technique using
	Monte Carlo simulation by generating pseudorandom data from five
	skewed distributions: lognormal, gamma, Weibull, log-logistic, and
	inverse Gaussian. I then fit each data set under all five distributional
	assumptions, and examine how well AIC identifies the distribution
	that generated the data. On the basis of the simulations, I suggest
	that AIC is effective at identifying the data-generating distribution,
	given moderate to large sample sizes. I then fit four candidate models
	to data drawn from a mixture of four distributions with common expectations
	and coefficients of variation (CVs). AIC did not show strong support
	for a particular candidate model given small samples of ‘mixed’
	data, although larger samples selected the gamma distribution for
	CVs of 0.5 and 1.0, and the Weibull distribution for CVs of 1.5 and
	2.0. Finally, I apply this technique in a GLM setting to several
	fisheries-independent and -dependent data sets to select the error
	distribution that is best supported by the data. Twenty-one out of
	24 fisheries data sets examined showed strong support for one of
	the five candidate error distributions and the remaining moderate
	support for two.},

	fertilization success first increased and then decreased with mate

	yield (MSY) harvest rates greater than F-30% (the fishing mortality
	rate that reduces SPR to 30% of its unfished value) for all model

	stock of Pacific ocean perch was lower than F-70%. The SPR rates
	at MSY for other stocks were clustered between F-40% and F-60% and
	depended on both the stock-recruit model (Beverton-Holt or Ricker)
	and the model for recruitment variability (lognormal or gamma). Meta-analysis
	results should be interpreted cautiously due to autocorrelation in
	the model residuals for several stocks and the potential confounding

	the estimated F-MSY, rate for all West Coast rockfish stocks with
	the exception of black rockfish S. melanops. A harvest rate of, F-50%,

	β diversity, measured as change in community composition. Contrary
	to our expectations, we did not detect systematic loss of α diversity.
	However, community composition changed systematically through time,
	in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of
	environmental change, species range shifts associated with climate
	change, and biotic homogenization may explain the different patterns
	of temporal α and β diversity. Monitoring and understanding change
	in species composition should be a conservation priority.},

	B. grypus with a mean weight of 835.0 to 1012.0 g, were caught from
	Karoon river and transferred alive to the laboratory. After biometrical
	studies, the weights and morphological appearances of gonads were
	recorded. Then, tissue samples from the anterior, middle and posterior
	portions of the gonad were excised and fixed in Bouin’s solution.
	For microscopical studies, 5 μm paraffin sections were prepared
	and stained with haematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid Schiff
	(PAS). Gonado-somatic indices, macroscopical and microscopical changes
	of ovaries were studied during different months of the year. The
	results showed that gonado-somatic index ranged from 0.35 ± 0.080%
	in September to 2.25 ± 0.321% in June, and the maximum values were
	seen in June. Cyclic changes of ovarian maturation were divided into
	seven stages histologically. Ovarian maturation cycle in B. grypus
	began in late summer. Spawning period of B. grypus continued approximately
	from late April to early August, which indicated that B. grypus has
	a prolonged spawning season. Ovarian type of B. grypus was group

	that of C. armatus. C. acrolepis allocated nearly equal amounts of
	energy to metabolism and growth. Once sexual maturity was reached
	reproduction became the dominant energetic cost. Either these costs
	are necessary to retain adequate numbers of eggs and larvae on the
	continental slopes, or this fish does not reproduce on an annual
	basis and the calculated costs are an overestimate. C. armatus allocated
	relatively more energy to metabolism than growth. It may be semelparous,
	and this strategy would be of great energetic savings in its food-poor
	but stable environment. Individual daily ration for C. acrolepis
	decreased from 0.31% to 0.07% of body weight (BW) and for C. armatus
	from 0.12% to 0.02% BW with increasing fish length. These rates are
	substantially lower than those for fishes living in cold waters on
	the continental shelves. The population feeding rates for C. acrolepis
	ranged from 0.8 to 15 kg km(-2) day(-1) and for C. armatus from 5
	to 2,800 g km day(-1). The scavenging behaviour of C. acrolepis was

	benthos. It was estimated that the carrion eaten by C. acrolepis
	is equivalent to 0.04 mg C m(-2) day(-1) or only 0.2-0.4% of the
	average small particulate flux. Carrion consumption is important

	The PMRNs for 5-year-old males are similar in the two populations,

	for 5-year-old males exhibits a steady downward trend (beginning
	at 31 cm and ending at 26 cm), their PMRNs vary over a much narrower
	range (25-27 cm) and do not exhibit a consistent temporal trend.
	These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that most of
	the observed change in maturation since introduction is a product
	of phenotypic plasticity, driven by environmentally based differences
	in growth rate. Our study provides an instructive example of how

	correlated with the developmental mode of the young; "altricial"
	(helpless) or "precocial" (independent). Using a data set of extant
	taxa we show that altricial birds lay relatively larger eggs than
	their precocial counterparts but that this may be due to the small
	size of most altricial species. Smaller birds tend to lay relatively
	small eggs compared to large species. Nonetheless, a predictive egg
	mass-body mass relationship extends into the avian fossil record.
	Such a relationship is important to our understanding of avian evolution
	because relative egg size (and thus available developmental mode)
	was constrained in many early birds oviduct diameter was limited
	by the presence of pubic fusion. Therefore we document the evolution
	of avian developmental strategies using morphology-based phylogenies
	for Mesozoic and extant avians and corroborate correlations between
	developmental strategies, egg weight and female body mass. The sequential
	loss of precocial features in hatchlings characterises the evolution
	of birds while altriciality is derived within Neoaves. A set of precocial
	strategies is seen in earlier lineages, including basal Neornithes
	(modern birds) and are implied in their Mesozoic counterparts-skeletal
	constraints on egg size, present in many Jurassic and Early Cretaceous
	birds (Archaeopteryx, Confuciusornis. Enantiornithes) were lost in
	later diverging lineages. Attributes of precociality were already
	present in a number of lineages of non-avian maniraptoran theropods.
	We propose that the evolution of "unrestricted egg size" may have
	precipitated subsequent development of the diverse reproductive strategies
	seen in living birds.},

	published data set, and 98 'Other species' from 51 genera in 25 families,
	also from published data. The relationship between ln(elaiosome size)
	and ln(seed size) was determined using standard major axis (SMA)
	regression for both data sets. For the Other data set we also determined
	the relationship among species independent of the differences between
	genera, among genera independent of the differences between families,
	among genera and among families. We used SMA to test for differences
	in slopes between groups. We found a significant common slope amongst
	all subsets of the larger data set. The estimated common slope and
	the 95% confidence interval for the relationship between ln(elaiosome
	size) and ln(seed size) across all data sets fell above one (1.24,
	95% CI = 1.17-1.32), suggesting positive allometry. Slopes were also
	significantly positive and strikingly similar between the Acacia
	species data set and the Other species data sets. Similar positive
	allometry was shown in the 'other' species data set among genera
	and families, and among species independent of genus means ('species
	effects'). Significant and consistent relationships between taxonomic
	levels, independent of relationships at other levels, along with
	significant relationships at the species level, and similarity of
	slopes, suggest independent convergence towards an underlying functional
	relationship that has persisted over long evolutionary periods. Our
	results therefore suggest that ants have been agents of selection
	on seed traits. Such a functional relationship might result from
	a trade-off in ant foraging behaviour between the benefit of the
	reward (elaiosome) and the cost of the dispersal (determined by seed
	size). Slopes > 1 would then suggest that ants need more than proportionally
	larger rewards to remove larger seeds.},

	to a state of commercial extinction in the 1960s, probably due to
	both overexploitation and unfavourable climatic conditions. Since

	the fish matured at much earlier ages and somewhat larger sizes than
	previously. Currently, age and size at 50% maturity have only to
	some extent returned to pre-collapse levels. Two non-exclusive hypotheses
	that may account for the maturity changes are (1) the 'compensatory
	response' hypothesis, predicting that reduced stock size resulting
	from exploitation leads to faster growth and hence earlier maturity
	as a phenotypically plastic response to environmental change; and
	(2) the 'evolutionary response' hypothesis, predicting that intensive
	exploitation causes selection for early maturation, since few late-maturing
	phenotypes survive until first spawning. Trends in length-at-age
	suggest a strong compensatory response, but leave the possibility
	of evolutionary change unaddressed. In order to disentangle phenotypic
	and possible genetic changes in maturation, we examined the reaction
	norm for age and size at maturation to see if any changes had occurred.
	This reaction norm describes the probabilities of maturing at each
	relevant age and size. We found small but statistically significant
	changes in maturation reaction norms; these changes were restricted
	to 2 out of 6 of the maturation ages. This confirms that growth-related
	phenotypic plasticity has largely been responsible for the documented
	changes in maturity, and suggests at most a weak evolutionary response.
	This is in line with theoretical expectations from the dominating
	fishing pattern, where pure schools of only mature or only early
	immature fish were targeted, rather than a fishery on both immature
	and mature fish simultaneously, as has been the case in stocks of
	cod Gadus morhua and plaice Pleuronectes platessa, where significant

  abstract = {Origins of biotic seed dispersal by vertebrates and evolution of different
	seed sizes are conspicuous features in angiosperm evolution. In the
	Cretaceous, angiosperms remained small seeded, and biotic seed dispersal
	was rare. In the Early Tertiary, average seed size increased drastically,
	and biotic seed dispersal by vertebrates became common. Later in
	the Tertiary, along with climate cooling and the opening of vegetation,
	average seed size dropped. Fossil data suggest a positive correlation
	between seed size and biotic seed dispersal. This article examines
	three hypotheses: ( 1) the coevolution hypothesis, which suggests
	that evolution of large seeds and biotic dispersal were driven by
	interactions between plants and frugivorous vertebrates; ( 2) the
	recruitment hypothesis, which suggests that vegetation change altered
	recruitment conditions that favored large seeds and in turn promoted
	biotic dispersal; and ( 3) the life-form hypothesis, which suggests
	that large seeds and biotic dispersal evolved as coadapted traits
	along with evolution of large plant life-forms. The hypotheses are
	complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Evidence suggest that
	changes in vegetation structure ( open vs. closed) are probably a
	primary driving mechanism of seed size and dispersal evolution, but
	life-forms, seed sizes, and biotic dispersal systems have evolved
	as coadapted sets of traits in response to these environmental changes.},

	the Gulf corvina (Cynoscion othonopterus) fishery in the Gulf of
	California from 1997 to 2012 and to investigate the effects of gear
	selectivity and age-dependent variation in spawning frequency on
	estimates of sustainability in spawning aggregation fisheries. The
	length composition of the catch varied significantly among years
	but showed no clear directional pattern. However, the average length
	was above the long term average after the implementation of a regulation
	that standardized mesh size of nets, and the average length of fish
	captured after the implementation was significantly higher than during
	previous periods. Results using three simple metrics based on catch
	length compositions indicated that fishing activities were sustainable
	due to the exclusion of juveniles from the fishery and the targeted
	harvest of adults at the optimal length. However, the low proportion
	of older, fecund fish in the fishery is a serious cause for concern.
	Modeled estimates of spawning potential ratios (SPR) were consistently
	higher when spawning frequency was assumed to be age invariant and
	were significantly higher after the implementation of gear regulations.
	However, SPR values only reached levels above 35%, a common reference
	point for sciaenid fishes, during the current fishing period (2010–2012)
	under conditions of age invariant spawning frequency. Results of
	this study support previous claims that suggest estimates of reproductive
	potential are highly sensitive to age-dependent variation in spawning
	frequency and imply that such details related to spawning behavior
	require more attention, particularly for fisheries that target spawning
	aggregations. Our results also suggest that spawning aggregations
	can be harvested sustainably through conventional regulations if
	juveniles are excluded, fish are harvested at optimal length, and
	older, fecund individuals are protected from harvest. Given the uncertainty
	of the status of the corvina fishery based on the discordant results
	of this study and the inherent vulnerability of the species to overfishing,
	We recommend the precautionary approach be applied to management
	decisions until more robust information is acquired on stock abundance,
	the relationship between spawning frequency and age or length, and

	decrease in the pool extent during fertilization as compared with
	unfertilized oocytes controls. Interestingly, this decrease in free
	tubulin in the fertilized trout oocyte appeared to be accompanied

	temperature changes from 4 to 26.5 degrees C of fertilized eggs resulted
	in a transient increase in the soluble tubulin pools during the initial
	5-min heat incubation, decaying after 10 min treatment, to reach
	at 15 min the levels of soluble tubulin pools of untreated controls.
	Total tubulin pools remained constant during the heat incubations

	was also investigated using the specific immunological probes. In
	contrast to tubulin no major differences were found between free
	MAPs pools of the fertilized oocytes as compared with unfertilized

	The main scientific international commissions strongly recommend
	standardizing methodologies across countries and scientists. Unfortunately,
	there is still a great deal of uncertainty concerning macroscopic
	identification, which remains to be validated. The current paper
	analyses reproductive data of European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus
	L. 1758), collected during three summer surveys (2001, 2005 and 2006)
	in the Strait of Sicily, to evaluate the uncertainty in the macroscopic
	maturity stage identification and the reliability of the macroscopic
	adopted scale. On board the survey vessels, the maturity stage of
	each fish was determined macroscopically by means of an adopted maturity
	scale subdivided in six stages. Later, at the laboratory, the gonads
	were prepared for histological examination. The histological slides
	were analysed, finally assigning the six maturity stages for macroscopic
	examinations. A correspondence table was obtained with the proportion
	and number of matches between the two methods. The results highlight
	critical aspects in the ascription of macroscopic maturity stages,
	particularly for the present research aim. Different recommendations
	were evaluated depending on the scope of the study conducted on maturity
	(e. g. daily egg production, fecundity and maturity ogive computation).
	The most interesting results concern the misclassification of stage
	IV and stages III and V (the most abundant), which confirms their
	macroscopic similarity. Although the results are based on a small
	number of samples, the advantages and disadvantages of macroscopic
	and histological methods are discussed with the aim to increase the
	accuracy of correct identification and to standardize macroscopic
	maturity ascription criteria.},

	and implemented as management tools for achieving both fisheries
	and conservation objectives in aquatic ecosystems. However, there
	is a challenge associated with the application of MPAs in marine
	resource management with respect to the consequences to traditional
	systems of monitoring and managing fisheries resources. The place-based
	paradigm of MPAs can complicate the population-based paradigm of
	most fisheries stock assessments. In this review, we identify the
	potential complications that could result from both existing and
	future MPAs to the science and management systems currently in place
	for meeting conventional fisheries management objectives. The intent
	is not to evaluate the effects of implementing MPAs on fisheries
	yields, or even to consider the extent to which MPAs may achieve
	conservation oriented objectives, but rather to evaluate the consequences
	of MPA implementation on the ability to monitor and assess fishery
	resources consistent with existing methods and legislative mandates.
	Although examples are drawn primarily from groundfish fisheries on
	the West Coast of the USA, the lessons are broadly applicable to
	management systems worldwide, particularly those in which there exists
	the institutional infrastructure for managing resources based on
	quantitative assessments of resource status and productivity.},

	potential of a population, such as spawning biomass. However, the
	correlation between spawning biomass and reproductive potential is
	not always strong, and it likely is weakest in the tropics and subtropics,
	where species tend to exhibit indeterminate fecundity and release
	eggs in batches over a protracted spawning season. In such cases,
	computing annual reproductive output requires estimates of batch
	fecundity and the annual number of batches—the latter subject to
	spawning frequency and duration of spawning season. Batch fecundity
	is commonly measured by age (or size), but these other variables
	are not. Without the relevant data, the annual number of batches

	sensitivity to age dependence in the annual number of batches. If
	the annual number of batches increases with age but is incorrectly
	assumed to be constant, stock assessment models would tend to overestimate

	study underscores the need to better understand the age- or size-dependent

  abstract = {Seed dormancy plays an important role in germination ecology and seed
	plant evolution. Morphological seed dormancy is caused by an underdeveloped
	embryo that must mature prior to germination. It has been suggested
	that the presence of an underdeveloped embryo is plesiomorphic among
	seed plants and that parallel directional change in embryo morphology
	has occurred separately in gymnosperms and in angiosperms. We test
	these hypotheses using original data on embryo morphology of key
	basal taxa, a published dataset, and the generalized least squares
	(GLS) method of ancestral character state reconstruction. Reconstructions
	for embryo to seed ratio (E:S) using family means for 179 families
	showed that E:S has increased between the ancestral angiosperm and
	almost all extant angiosperm taxa. Species in the rosid clade have
	particularly large embryos relative to the angiosperm ancestor. Results
	for the gymnosperms show a similar but smaller increase. There were
	no statistically significant differences in E:S between basal taxa
	and any derived group due to extremely large standard errors produced
	by GLS models. However, differences between reconstructed values
	for the angiosperm ancestor and more highly nested nodes are large
	and these results are robust to topological and branch-length manipulations.

	In such cases, maternal effects may evolve as mechanisms for transgenerational
	phenotypic plasticity whereby, in response to a predictive environmental
	cue, a mother can change the type of eggs that she makes or can program
	a developmental switch in her offspring, which produces offspring
	prepared for the environmental conditions predicted by the cue. One
	potentially common mechanism by which females manipulate the phenotype
	of their progeny is egg size plasticity, in which females vary egg
	size in response to environmental cues. We describe an experiment
	in which we quantify genetic variation in egg size and egg size plasticity
	in a. seed beetle, Stator limbatus, and measure the genetic constraints
	on the evolution of egg size plasticity, quantified as the genetic
	correlation between the size of eggs laid across host plants. We
	found that genetic variation is present within populations for the
	size of eggs laid on seeds of two host plants (Acacia greggii and
	Cercidium floridum; h(2) ranged between 0.217 and 0.908), and that
	the heritability of egg size differed between populations and hosts
	(higher on A. greggii than on C. floridum). We also found that the
	evolution of egg size plasticity (the maternal effect) is in part
	constrained by a high genetic correlation across host plants (r(G)
	> 0.6). However, the cross-environment genetic correlation is less
	than 1.0, which indicates that the size of eggs laid on these two
	hosts can diverge in response to natural selection and that egg size
	plasticity is thus capable of evolving in response to natural selection.},

	five lutjanids (Lutjanus synagris, L. jocu, L. analis, Ocyurus chrysurus

	A total of 3528 gonads were collected from May 2005 to October 2007.
	Temporal variability in spawning patterns was evaluated using the
	Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) and macroscopic analyses. The peak of reproductive
	activity for the three grouper species occurred between July and
	August. Snappers exhibited two peaks of reproductive activity, the
	more intense of which occurred between September and October. The
	other peak occurred between February and March, with the exception
	of the deep-dwelling species R. aurorubens, which only reproduced
	between February and March. Seasonal patterns were consistent over
	the two consecutive years that we studied, and these patterns are
	equivalent to those observed for the Northern Hemisphere, as are
	the sizes at maturity and at the time of sexual change (for the three

	region could be significantly improved by a combination of catch
	and effort limitations being imposed during spawning seasons and
	by overall size limitations, particularly considering that most of
	the fish caught are generally below size at maturity. The proposed
	buffer zones for the marine areas that are presently protected in
	Abrolhos represent an opportunity for implementing both spatial (e.g.
	setting no-take zones that cover spawning sites) and temporal (e.g.
	seasonal closures during spawning peaks) management tools, using

  abstract = {This study aims to test whether exploitation affects tunas and tuna-like
	species displaying contrasting life history traits similarly. We
	first collected information on life history of 10 commercial Atlantic
	species and then compared this information using multivariate analysis.
	On one hand, tropical tunas are characterised by small to medium
	size, rapid growth, early age-at-maturity, long spawning duration
	and short life span. These species, therefore, display a rapid turnover,
	characteristic of r-selected species. On the other hand, temperate
	tunas display differing life history traits, i.e., large size, slow
	growth, late age-at-maturity, short spawning duration and long life
	span. The turnover of these species is slow and present characteristics
	similar to 'K-selected' species (with a conservative strategy adapted
	to a colder and more variable environment). We, then, selected the
	two tuna species displaying the most contrasting life histories,
	i.e., skipjack (SKJ) and bluefin tuna (BFT), and investigated their
	respective responses to various levels of exploitation, using simulation
	modelling. If fishing activity starts at age I (a situation which
	is close to the actual exploitation pattern), differences in life
	history traits make the BFT population much more fragile to exploitation
	and less productive than SKJ. However, if the fisheries only target
	adults, both SKJ and BFT populations are able to sustain high F.
	Spawning stocks and yields of BFT also display conspicuous long-term
	fluctuations, resulting from the combination of year-to-year variations
	in the recruitment and a long life span. This variability makes it
	difficult to detect overfishing or depletion risks in the BFT population.
	Because of its short life span, SKI does not display such long-term
	variations in its SSB. Our simulations also showed that current management
	measures based on a minimum size limit are much more critical for
	BFT than SKJ. This difference stresses the importance of taking account
	of differences in life history traits into management measures. (C)

	of the world's largest fisheries, but since the early 1990s has been
	in a collapsed and post-industrial state. Extreme life history trait
	changes have occurred in this stock, most evident in early maturation
	and increased fecundity and mortality. Using historical data from
	the early 1960s (pre-industrial) and previously unpublished data
	from 1999 and 2003 (post-industrial), we show co-variation of these
	traits. Few fish in the later period reached 6 years of age or >60cm
	(formerly many reached >12 years and >80cm), but fecundity at size
	in the early maturing fish was higher than ever recorded in any cod
	stock. Post-industrial cod at 4 years had a potential fecundity of
	about 0.5 million eggs, which did not occur until age 6 in pre-industrial
	times. Coincidentally, mortality was low during the pre-industrial
	period but increased dramatically in the post-industrial period.
	Using an egg-per-recruit model, fit to age and length structure data
	from the two periods, we also show how reduced survivorship, earlier
	age at maturity and increased fecundity resulted in a compensated
	fecundity per recruit that was >75% of pre-industrial levels. The
	cause of these changes, whether they represent traits selected for
	by the fishery, responses to reduced densities, or a combination
	of these factors is discussed, but remains uncertain.},

  journal = {Ecology},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {Food web relationships are traditionally defined in terms of the flow
	of key elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, and their
	role in limiting production. There is growing recognition that availability
	of important biomolecules, such as fatty acids, may exert controls
	on secondary production that are not easily explained by traditional
	element-oriented models. Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are required
	by most organisms for proper physiological function but are manufactured
	almost entirely by primary producers. Therefore, the flow of EFAs,
	especially DHA, EPA, and ARA, through aquatic food webs is critical
	for ecosystem functioning. A meta-analysis of data on EFA content
	of marine organisms reveals that individual eggs of marine animals
	have exceptionally high concentrations of EFAs, and that superabundances
	of eggs released in temporally and spatially discrete patches create
	rich but temporary nutritional resources for egg predators, called
	"egg boons." Mortality rates of fish eggs are disproportionately
	higher than animals of similar size, and those eggs are consumed
	by predators both larger and smaller than the adults that produce
	the eggs. Thus, egg boons are a major trophic pathway through which
	EFAs are repackaged and redistributed, and they are among the few
	pathways that run counter to the main direction of trophic flow.
	Egg boons can transport EFAs across ecosystems through advection
	of patches of eggs and spawning migrations of adults. Recognizing
	the significance of egg boons to aquatic food webs reveals linkages
	and feedbacks between organisms and environments that have important
	implications for understanding how food webs vary in time and space.
	Examples are given of top-down, bottom-up, and lateral control mechanisms
	that could significantly alter food webs through their effects on
	eggs. Our results suggest that trophodynamic food web models should
	include EFAs generally, and egg production and egg EFA content in
	particular.},

  abstract = {Fish species are diverse. For example, some exhibit early maturation
	while others delay maturation, some adopt semelparous reproductive
	strategies while others are iteroparous, and some are long-lived
	and others short-lived. The diversity is likely to have profound
	effects on fish population dynamics, which in turn has implications
	for fisheries management. In this study, a simple density-dependent
	stage-structured population model was used to investigate the effect
	of life history traits on sustainable yield, population resilience,
	and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the adult abundance. The
	study showed that semelparous fish can produce very high sustainable
	yields, near or above 50% of the carrying capacity, whereas long-lived
	iteroparous fish can produce very low sustainable yields, which are
	often much less than 10% of the carrying capacity. The difference
	is not because of different levels of sustainable fishing mortality
	rate, but because of difference in the sensitivity of the equilibrium
	abundance to fishing mortality. On the other hand, the resilience
	of fish stocks increases from delayed maturation to early maturation
	strategies but remains almost unchanged from semelparous to long-lived
	iteroparous. The CV of the adult abundance increases with increased
	fishing mortality, not because more individuals are recruited into
	the adult stage (as previous speculated), but because the mean abundance
	is more sensitive to fishing mortality than its standard deviation.
	The magnitudes of these effects vary depending on the life history
	strategies of the fish species involved. It is evident that any past
	high yield of long-lived iteroparous fish is a transient yield level,
	and future commercial fisheries should focus more on fish that are
	short-lived (including semelparous species) with high compensatory
	capacity.},

	Using a data set containing over 10,000 sightings of photographically

	parameters since 1980. Here we construct, using these estimates,

	bias problems with field-collected European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus,

	in which the time elapsed from spawning (POF age) was estimated from
	the size of POFs (i.e., from the cross-sectional area in histological
	sections). The potential effect of the preservative type and embedding
	material on POF size and the effect of ambient water temperature

	highly significant log-linear relationship was found between POF
	area and age; POF area shrank by approximately 50% per day. POFs
	were also shown to shrink faster at higher temperatures (approximately
	3% per degree), but this temperature effect is unlikely to be an
	important source of bias in the assignment of females to daily spawning
	classes. The embedding material was also shown to influence the size

	Given that vitellogenesis in Atlantic sardine ceases at final oocyte
	maturation, OB was estimated by measuring the size of oocytes of
	the subsequent batch in females with hydrated oocytes. The resulting
	average ISI was very close to inverse values of the spawning fraction
	estimated through the postovulatory follicle method, which indicated
	the validity of the ISI method. Applications of the ISI method require
	fewer samples of adult females compared with the postovulatory follicle
	method, are histology independent, and could be combined with oocyte
	counts to provide batch fecundity measurements. These modifications
	in spawning frequency and batch fecundity estimation could help to
	decrease both cost and labor in daily egg production method surveys.},

	Ceratoscopelus species (cf warmingii), Diaphus dumerilii, Lampanyctus
	alatus, Lepidophanes guentheri, Myctophum affine, and Notolychnus
	valdiviae. Overall sex ratios differed significantly from parity
	only in Ceratoscopelus species (cf warmingii) because of size dimorphism
	among the largest individuals. Oocyte development was typically teleostean
	and did not differ among the seven species. In all species, maximum
	oocyte diameter at hydration was about 0.5 mm, which was smaller
	than has been reported for conspecifics from other parts of their
	range. Sizes at sexual maturity and maximum lengths were also smaller
	when compared to conspecifics outside the Gulf of Mexico. An increasing
	percentage of advanced stage (migratory nucleus and hydrated) oocytes
	with increasing length was observed among all species, which suggested
	that spawning frequency increased as the fishes grew larger. Among
	species for which data were available, spawning occurred only during
	the night at epipelagic depths with peak activity generally after
	midnight. Two basic reproductive patterns were noted: 1) a protracted
	spawning season of 4- to 6-months duration, with individuals spawning
	every 1 to 4 days (Benthosema suborbitale, Lampanyctus alatus, Lepidophanes
	guentheri, and Notolychnus valdiviae); 2) more restricted spawning
	periods which primarily occurred once or twice a year (Ceratoscopelus
	species and probably Diaphus dumerilii). Diaphus dumerilii, though
	present in great numbers in the eastern Gulf, was represented almost
	solely by juveniles and subadults. Available evidence indicated that
	upon reaching sexual maturity, Diaphus dumerilii shifted to a pseudoceanic
	or possibly benthopelagic lifestyle, with spawning activities restricted
	to waters overlying the shelf edge. Protracted spawners all shared
	bimodal oocyte size frequencies among the most advanced oocyte stages
	with both modes being nearly equivalent in frequency, a linear increase
	in fecundity with increasing length, batch fecundities in the low
	hundreds to low thousands and an average life span of 1 year or less.
	Seasonally restricted spawners also exhibited bimodal oocyte size
	frequencies but with a greatly reduced frequency in the second mode,
	an exponential increase in fecundity with increasing size, batch
	fecundities in the high thousands to low ten thousands, and a life
	span of less than 1 to about 2 years. The energetic cost of maximum
	reproductive output at the maximum rate of spawning was about 30%
	of the daily assimilated caloric ration in the protracted spawner
	Lepidophanes guentheri. This suggested that myctophids are capable
	of sustaining either reproductive pattern, but that growth will most
	probably slow at larger sizes. Both reproductive strategies allow
	myctophids in the eastern Gulf to have spawning season (=lifetime
	in annual species) fecundities that far exceed the low batch fecundities.

  abstract = {The Beverton-Holt length-based mortality estimator has received widespread
	use primarily due to its applicability in data-limited situations.
	The mean length of animals that are fully vulnerable to the sampling
	gear can be used to estimate total mortality from basic growth parameters
	and a known length at first capture. This method requires equilibrium
	conditions because the mean length of a population will change only
	gradually after a change in mortality. In this study, we derive the
	transitional behavior of the mean length statistic for use in nonequilibrium
	conditions. We investigate conditions affecting the reliability of
	the Beverton-Holt results and then develop a new procedure that allows
	a series of mortality rates to be estimated from mean length data
	representing nonequilibrium conditions in multiple years. We then
	examine an assessment of goosefish Lophins americanus that was criticized
	for its use of the Beverton-Holt estimator under nonequilibrium conditions.
	Using data from the 1963-2002 National Marine Fisheries Service annual
	fall groundfish surveys off the northeastern United States and assuming
	a single change in total mortality, we used the maximum likelihood
	method to estimate that the total mortality of goosefish in the southern
	assessment region increased from 0.31 to 0.60 per year in 1977. Estimates
	of the new mortality rate made three or more years after the change
	were relatively stable and only ranged from 0.55 to 0.71 per year,
	while estimates from the standard Beverton-Holt approach ranged from
	0.37 to 1.1 per year. The results for goosefish in the northern assessment
	region showed that total mortality changed from 0.14 to 0.29 per
	year in 1978 and then to 0.55 per year in 1987. The new nonequilibrium
	estimator allows a change in mortality to be characterized reliably
	several years faster than would occur with the use of the Beverton-Holt

	a function of both length and age. Proportions of mature individuals

	classes below 15 cm to around 0.9 at 25 cm, whilst almost all 2-year-old
	males were mature from their smallest length of around 19 cm. Maturity
	in females was more strongly linked to age than to length. Most 1-year-old
	females were immature, the proportion of mature individuals not exceeding
	0.3 in any length class. Most 2-year-old females were mature and
	immature fish were found in the smallest length classes only (20-25
	cm). Almost all 3-year-olds of both sexes were mature in all length
	classes. Proportions of mature individuals in 1-year-olds increased
	substantially after 1997, particularly in males. Significant positive

	the consequences of adaptive life-history evolution on locomotor

	of resources toward reproduction. These populations are also under
	strong selection for rapid fast-start swimming performance to evade
	predators. Because embryo development increases a female's wet mass
	as she approaches parturition, an increased investment in reproductive
	allocation should impede fast-start performance. We find evidence
	for adaptive but constrained evolution of fast-start swimming performance
	in laboratory trials conducted on second-generation lab-reared fish.
	Female guppies from high-predation localities attain a faster acceleration
	and velocity and travel a greater distance during fast-start swimming
	trials. However, velocity and distance traveled decline more rapidly
	over the course of pregnancy in these same females, thus reducing
	the magnitude of divergence in swimming performance between high-

	assemblages) of rocky reef fishes at a spatial scale relevant to
	management, and compared the outcomes for this biodiversity from
	alternative procedures for selecting marine protected areas (MPAs)
	and from the selection of MPAs for fisheries-related objectives.
	2. The study area included 104 species in two assemblage types; 36
	species and 14 species occurred only in one or two locations respectively.
	3. MPAs selected by hotspot richness, greedy richness complementarity,
	and summed irreplaceability included similar percentages of species
	and significantly more species than randomly selected MPAs. A combined
	species-assemblage selection ensured representation of assemblage
	diversity. Representation of all species and assemblage types required
	92% of locations. 4. MPAs chosen using density of all fishes or density
	of exploitable fishes as selection criteria included fewer species
	(than MPAs selected using species identity) and the percentage of
	species accumulated did not differ from a random selection. 5. Use
	of an established MPA as the seed for an expanded network was inefficient,
	leading to additional locations being required and an accumulation
	of species that did not differ front a random selection. 6. The smallest
	MPA network that fulfilled multiple management objectives (representation
	of assemblage diversity and majority of species, population viability,
	support for fisheries, connectivity) required 30% of the surveyed
	locations. 7. This study concluded that: MPAs selected without the
	benefit of data on intra-habitat variation in species assemblages
	will be unrepresentative; the upper range of currently promoted targets
	for MPA establishment (i.e. 30%) should be regarded as a minimum
	for biodiversity conservation; MPAs selected for fisheries-related
	reasons may not provide expected benefits for the remainder of the
	fish assemblage. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	methodology for each habitat. Fishes in both habitats were sampled
	independently using BRUVS with soak times of 30, 60, 90 min (n =
	4). Thirty five species of fishes were recorded including 18 species
	of economic importance. Mean number of species, mean total Max N
	and mean Max N of species did not differ among soak times. Precision
	was generally greater in seagrass and in both habitats it improved
	with increasing soak time. Bootstrapping revealed that greater improvements
	in precision occurred from increasing soak time rather than increasing
	replication. A sampling design with n = 5 replicates of 90 min soak
	time was optimal for most variables. This sampling effort is greater
	than many current applications of BRUVS. The results highlight the

	lobsters were more likely to exhibit disease symptoms than males,

  abstract = {Male fertility has seldom been studied in natural populations because
	it has been assumed that strong selection would result in uniformly
	high values among males, and therefore mating success has been equated
	with fertilisation success. In contrast, male fertility has received
	much attention in studies of domestic livestock, where economic benefits
	rely on improving productivity, and in human infertility studies,
	where the efficiency of treatments depends on understanding which
	ejaculate traits explain reproductive failures and predict success
	at assisted conception. Despite years of efforts, no conclusive results
	have been obtained, probably because such studies have focused on
	opposite extremes of the range with little variation: domestic livestock
	have often been subject to strong artificial selection for high fertility,
	and human patients requiring treatment have compromised fertility.
	Recent findings from natural populations of red deer have shown that
	males differ markedly in their fertility, and have revealed the degree
	of variation found in different semen traits, both between and within
	males. Fertility trials have shown that male fertility is determined
	mainly by sperm swimming speed and the proportion of normal sperm,
	when sperm numbers are kept constant. Sperm design exerts a strong
	influence on sperm swimming speed, with faster swimming sperm having
	elongated heads, shorter midpieces and a longer principal plus terminal
	pieces in relation to total flagellum length. Thus, the large inter-male
	variation in sperm design found among natural populations underlies
	differences in sperm swimming speed which, in turn, determine differences
	in male fertility rates. Secondary sexual characters are honest indicators
	of male fertility, so males with large and elaborated antlers have
	larger testes and faster swimming sperm. Testosterone does not seem
	to mediate the relationship between antler size and semen quality,
	since it is associated with sperm production, but not with sperm
	quality or antler size. Finally, more fertile males produce a greater
	proportion of sons, who will inherit the semen traits which will
	enhance their fertility.},

	the performance of no-take marine reserves protecting transient spawning
	aggregations. The model consists of only 14 demographic and exploitation-related
	parameters. We applied the model to a protogynous grouper and a gonochoristic
	rabbitfish from Seychelles and tested six scenarios regarding the
	extent of protected areas, the level of fish spawning-site fidelity,
	and fishing effort redistribution post reserve implementation. Spawning
	aggregation reserves improve spawning-stock biomass-per-recruit and
	reduce the sex ratio bias in protogynous populations for all scenarios
	examined. However, these benefits are often small and vary among
	the different scenarios and as a function of sexual ontogeny. In
	all scenarios, increases in yield-per-recruit do not occur or are
	negligible. The long-term yield increases due to spawning aggregation
	reserves may still occur, but only if spawning-stock biomass recovery
	results in a recruitment subsidy. Given these limited benefits, the
	value of no-take reserves must be weighed against those of other
	management options, such as fishing effort reduction and seasonal
	fishery closures. The latter is particularly appropriate when spawning
	and non-spawning areas overlap in space.},

	rather than failure of the MPA concept. Results from both the empirical

	FSA MPAs, additional modelling work, long-term monitoring programmes

	reduction in mortality rates should be targeted first. Fisheries
	objectives build on conservation objectives, in that they require
	an overall reduction in mortality rates while maintaining sufficient
	access to exploitable biomass. Communication among researchers, regulatory

	This study examined spatial position within egg clutches as a source

	of a rare species can be determined? The Poisson and the negative

	The Poisson assumption leads to the simple relationship n = -(1/m)log
	beta, where n is the number of quadrats needed to detect the presence
	of a species having density m, with a chance beta (the Type 2 error
	probability) that the species will not be collected in any of the

	to be used. Published sampling distributions of 37 unionid mollusc
	species over river miles (distance measured along the path of the

	evaluated to determine the appropriateness of the simple Poisson-
	based formula for estimation of necessary sample size to detect species
	presence. For each of 273 species x river mile combinations we estimated
	the mean, the variance, and the negative binomial parameter k, and
	then estimated ''necessary n'' from both the Poisson- and the negative-binomial-based
	formulae. We defined ''Poisson adequacy'' to be the proportion that
	the Poisson estimate is of the negative binomial estimate of necessary
	sample size, and stated the requirement that it be >0.95. Only 8
	of the 273 cases represented rare species that failed this requirement.
	Thus we conclude that a Poisson-based estimate of necessary sample

	The follicle is a derivative of the germinal epithelium and is composed

  abstract = {In this paper we propose an explanation for (a) the predominance of
	male care in fishes, and (b) the phylogenies and transitions that
	occur among care states. We also provide a general evolutionary model
	for studying the conditions under which parental care evolves. Our
	conclusions are as follows: (i) Parental care has only one benefit,
	the increased survivorship of young. It may, however, have three
	costs: a “mating cost,? an “adult survivorship cost,? and
	a “future fertility cost.? (ii) On average, males and females
	will derive the same benefit from care. They probably also pay the
	same adult survivorship cost. However, their mating cost and future
	fertility costs may differ, (iii) A mating cost usually applies only
	to males. However, this cost may be reduced by male territoriality
	and, in some situations, be entirely removed. Under this condition,
	natural selection on present reproductive success is equivalent for
	males and females, (iv) When fecundity accelerates with body size
	in females, while male mating success follows a linear relationship
	with body size, future fertility costs of parental care are greater
	for females than males. Although further tests are needed, a preliminary
	analysis suggests this often may be the case in fishes. Thus, the
	predominance of male parental care in fishes is not explained by
	males deriving greater benefits from care, but by males paying smaller
	future costs. Males thus accrue a greater net fitness advantage from
	parental care (see expressions [6] and [12]). (v) The evolution of
	biparental care from uniparental male care may occur because male
	care selects for larger egg sizes and increased embryo investment
	by females. This increases the benefit to the female of parental
	care, (vi) By contrast, uniparental female care may originate from
	biparental care when males are selected to desert. This occurs when
	female care creates a mating cost to males. In some cases male desertion
	may “lock? females into uniparental care. However, in many other
	cases females may be selected to desert, giving rise to “no care.?
	(vii) The origin of uniparental female care from no care is rare
	in externally fertilizing fishes. This is because the benefits of
	care rarely outweigh a female's future fertility costs (expression
	[9]). For internally fertilizing species, however, the benefit of
	care is high whereas the cost is probably low. Most of these species
	have evolved embryo retention, (viii) When parental care begins with
	male care and moves to biparental care, our analysis suggests that
	care evolution will include cyclical dynamics. Parental care in some
	fishes may thus be seen as transitional and changing through evolutionary
	time rather than as an evolutionarily stable state. In theory, “no
	care? may be a phylogenetically advanced state.},

	These models predicted that a marine reserve would result in a decrease
	in fishery yield, an increase in spawning biomass and that movements
	of fish across the reserve boundaries could reduce its benefits.
	We utilised an age-structured model based on an Atlantic cod population
	that included more realistic reproductive factors. We compared a
	Reserve regime that contained a reserve with a No-reserve regime
	in which the usual fishery management tools were used. As exploitation
	rate increased, the relative recruitment and spawners biomass decreased
	in the No-reserve regime. Larger reserves resulted in more robust
	recruitment and biomass of spawners. At low exploitation rates, marine
	reserves resulted in smaller yields. However, when the exploitation
	rate was larger than the rate which gives the maximum sustainable
	yield, the biomass of female spawners was maintained at a higher
	level in the Reserve regime and hence the yield did not collapse.
	Faster rate of movement of fish decreased these advantages, but the
	higher spawners biomass and level of recruitment still provided advantages
	for the Reserve regime. Moreover, even for highly mobile fish, our
	model suggests that a fish stock protected with a marine reserve
	would be more resilient to exploitation than when managed without.
	However, a model realistic spatially and temporally would be necessary
	to assess the usefulness of marine reserves to prevent overexploitation

  abstract = {Populations of broadcasting reef corals often exhibit marked reproductive
	seasonality and spawning synchrony. Within speciose coral assemblages
	there is often considerable overlap of spawning periods among species,
	resulting in multi-species spawning events (or "mass coral spawning").
	Earlier geographical comparisons of reproductive synchrony suggested
	a reduction in the extent of mass spawning with proxiniity to the
	equator. In contrast, recent studies have revealed that reproductive
	seasonality and spawning synchrony within and among species are features
	of coral assemblages on equatorial reefs. Here we review the proposed
	causes of synchronous spawning among reef corals and discuss how
	recent findings about reproduction of corals from Singapore's equatorial
	reefs shed light on these various theories. Sexual reproduction in
	broadcasting corals requires external fertilization, so reproductive
	seasonality (leading to spawning synchrony) within populations is
	probably highly adaptive because synchrony increases the chances
	of gametes meeting, enhances the possibility of outbreeding and may
	swamp opportunistic predators. No coastal location is truly aseasonal,
	with even equatorial reefs experiencing marked (albeit less pronounced)
	rhythmic changes in sea surface temperature. Consequently, if species
	respond similarly but independently to timing cues to synchronize
	reproduction within populations, mass spawning is just as likely
	to occur in equatorial coral assemblages as it is at higher latitudes.},

	freshwater mussel fauna are poorly known. We investigated reproductive
	traits of eight riverine mussel species in Alabama and Mississippi,
	U.S.A.: Amblema plicata, Elliptio arca, Fusconaia cerina, Lampsilis
	ornata, Obliquaria reflexa, Pleurobema decisum, Quadrula asperata
	and Q. pustulosa, and compare our results with existing life history
	information for other species. 2. These eight species had reproductive
	traits characteristic of large, outcrossing populations: hermaphrodites
	were rare, we found no evidence of protandry, and sex ratios were
	even or slightly male-biased. 3. Age at sexual maturity varied among
	species, ranging from <1 to 2 years for L. ornata to 3-9 years for
	Q. asperata. In all species, most mature females participated in
	reproduction and fertilisation success was high. 5. Fecundity was
	related positively to both length and age, but length was the best
	predictor. In six species, fecundity increased exponentially with
	increasing size; in two species the rate of increase in fecundity
	declined in larger animals. In four species, fecundity declined in
	older animals. These latter results indicate weak reproductive senescence;
	however, in all species, older individuals continued to produce large
	numbers of offspring. Mean annual fecundity differed widely among
	species ranging from 9647 to 325 709. Within-species differences
	in fecundity were found among rivers and among populations within
	a river. 6. The wide variation in reproductive traits among species
	indicates the existence of widely divergent life history strategies
	in freshwater mussels.},

	a 486-bp segment of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA of all 24 seabream
	species described for the northeastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean
	to elucidate their generic and subfamily-level relationships. Three
	major mitochondrial lineages, each comprising species of different

	the present taxonomic assignments. Most of the investigated genera
	were resolved paraphyletically, indicating that the structure and
	arrangement of oral teeth must have repeatedly evolved from a less
	specialized ancestral condition. Further, the genus Sparus was resolved
	as distantly related to the genus Pagrus, in that it was assigned
	to a different major mitochondrial lineage. Oblada melanura was consistently
	placed within the Diplodus radiation as sister group to Diplodus
	puntazzo. Our phylogenetic hypothesis thus suggests multiple independent

	it is virtually impossible to understand its dynamics and trajectories
	by studying a single pair of interacting populations at one time.
	Comparing populations across a range of an interaction, especially
	for long-lived species, can provide insight into these features of
	coevolution by sampling across a diverse set of conditions and histories.
	We used measures of prey traits (tetrodotoxin toxicity in newts)
	and predator traits (tetrodotoxin resistance of snakes) to assess
	the degree of phenotypic mismatch across the range of their coevolutionary
	interaction. Geographic patterns of phenotypic exaggeration were
	similar in prey and predators, with most phenotypically elevated
	localities occurring along the central Oregon coast and central California.
	Contrary to expectations, however, these areas of elevated traits
	did not coincide with the most intense coevolutionary selection.
	Measures of functional trait mismatch revealed that over one-third
	of sampled localities were so mismatched that reciprocal selection
	could not occur given current trait distributions. Estimates of current
	locality-specific interaction selection gradients confirmed this
	interpretation. In every case of mismatch, predators were "ahead''
	of prey in the arms race; the converse escape of prey was never observed.
	The emergent pattern suggests a dynamic in which interacting species
	experience reciprocal selection that drives arms-race escalation
	of both prey and predator phenotypes at a subset of localities across
	the interaction. This coadaptation proceeds until the evolution of
	extreme phenotypes by predators, through genes of large effect, allows
	snakes to, at least temporarily, escape the arms race.},

	23, 1993 (LL), natural light from June 23, 1993 and continuous light
	from December 22, 1993 (LDN/LL) or continuous light from June 23,
	1993 and natural light from December 22, 1993 (LL/LDN). In July 1994,
	the LDN and LDN/LL groups were terminated. The LL and LL/LDN groups
	were reared on until May 1995. From July 1994 to the termination
	of the experiment in May 1995, the LL group was reared under continuous
	light and the LL/LDN group was reared under natural photoperiod.
	Cod reared under natural photoperiod spawned in the period between
	January and April. Photoperiod manipulation changed the incidence
	of sexual maturation, spawning time, fecundity and egg size. Cod
	that were transferred from natural photoperiod to continuous light
	in December spawned earlier, having lower fecundity and smaller eggs
	than the cod reared under natural photoperiod. Oocytes of females
	reared under continuous light were arrested in the cortical alveoli
	stage, and even in their second year on continuous light very few
	females matured. When transferred to natural photoperiod in December,
	females ovulated within 4-5 months, approximately 3 months delayed
	compared to the natural photoperiod group. These cod had a higher
	fecundity and smaller eggs than natural photoperiod cod. When reared
	on for another year under natural photoperiod these cod spawned again
	the next year at their normal spawning time, e.g. 9 months after
	their first spawning. The pattern of sexual maturation influenced
	the somatic growth pattern. Differences in growth were explained
	by differences in the timing of the spawning and the relative spawning
	investment. At an age of 26 months. the weight of the cod reared
	under natural photoperiod and continuous light were 1.5 and 2.5 kg.
	respectively. From this, it is concluded that a reduction in daylength
	is a vital environmental signal regulating the maturation and spawning
	of cod, and that sexual maturation may be arrested or considerably
	delayed in its absence, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

	a 12-month period from January 2004 to January 2005. The spawning
	season for banded wrasse from Otago was deduced to be from September
	through to December. The threshold diameter of oocytes undergoing
	germinal vesicle breakdown in vitro, therefore constituting a batch,
	was found to be c. 500 mu m. Batch fecundity was accordingly estimated
	at 74500 +/- 34900 eggs/kg body weight. On the basis of cyclic changes
	in gonadosomatic index and levels of the sex steroids estradiol-17
	beta and 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, it is likely
	that wrasse spawn once each lunar cycle during the spawning season,
	resulting in four batches of eggs each year around the time of the
	full moon. Calculated annual fecundity ranged between 298 000 (+/-
	139 600) and 447 000 (+/- 209 400) eggs/kg body weight. Notwithstanding
	inter-annual and inter-locational variation, these fecundity estimates
	provide a guideline for the management of banded wrasse.},

	of the ovaries. During the course of ovarian maturation, a portion

  abstract = {1. Trap fishing is widespread on coral reefs but the sustainability
	of this practice is causing concern because it is efficient and unselective.
	The effects of trap fishing were investigated by comparing fish assemblages
	among six Caribbean islands subject to different trapping pressures.
	These ranged from none in Bonaire and Saba increasing through Puerto
	Rico, St Lucia, Dominica and Jamaica respectively. 2. Fish were censused
	at depths of 5 m and 15 m on fore-reef slopes by counting the numbers
	within replicate 10 m diameter areas for 15 min. Between 64 and 1375
	counts were made in each country. 3. In St Lucia and Jamaica abundance
	of fish censused on the reef was compared to representation in traps
	which were visually sampled underwater in the area of fish counts.
	Twenty-three traps were sampled in Jamaica and 75 in St Lucia. For
	some comparisons between these islands, St Lucian sampling effort
	was reduced to that of Jamaica (23 traps and 112 counts) by randomly
	sub-sampling 10 times. 4. Traps contained 54 different species in
	St Lucia and 22 in Jamaica, while there were 90 and 57 respectively
	in counts. After reducing St Lucian sampling effort to Jamaican levels,
	an average of 35 species were found in traps and 70 seen in counts.
	Of these, 76% in St Lucia and 73% in Jamaica were relatively more
	abundant in traps than they were on the reef. 5. Species were considered
	to be highly susceptible to trapping if the ratio of their abundance
	in traps compared to that on the reef exceeded 3:1. Trapping pressure
	was approximately three and a half times greater in Jamaica than
	St Lucia. After equalizing sampling effort, there was an average
	of 16 highly trappable species in St Lucia compared to 13 in Jamaica.
	Species did not always appear highly trappable in both countries.
	Eleven of St Lucia's highly trappable species were absent from Jamaica
	(falling to 8.5 on average after equalizing sampling effort), but
	none vice versa, suggesting that trapping may have contributed to
	their absence or rarity on Jamaican reefs. 6. The Tetraodontiformes,
	which include many non-target species, were particularly susceptible
	to trapping in both countries. Their abundance in the six islands
	censused was inversely related to trap fishing pressure, as was that
	of two other non-target families, butterflyfish (Chaetodontidae)
	and angelfish (Pomacanthidae). 7. To determine whether fish that
	are common in traps in St Lucia are reaching sexual maturity before
	capture, size frequency data for 23 species from a sample of trap
	catches were gathered and examined for their state of maturity. In
	seven species, more than a third of 705 trapped fish were immature,
	indicating that trap fishing causes growth over-fishing (premature
	removal of fish), and calling into question the sustainability of
	yields for these species. 8. In conclusion, at the intensities seen
	in this study, trap fisheries cause serious over-fishing, reduce
	biodiversity, and alter ecosystem structure. While commonly perceived
	as low impact, coral reef trap fisheries in the Caribbean and further
	afield, need tighter regulation and control. Copyright (c) 2006 John

	growth rates reflect the unique exposure of each larva to the environment

  abstract = {The conservation of biodiversity is a major goal in nature conservation,
	but measuring the total biodiversity of a site or a region is not
	possible; thus there is a great demand for indicators to represent
	biodiversity. To be able to make use of indicators, criteria must
	first be established for their selection, and the degree to which
	the indicators meet the criteria must be tested. However, the purposes
	for which indicators are applied-and thus sometimes the criteria
	themselves-differ between ecological science and environmental policy.
	As transparency in choosing and testing suitable biodiversity indicators
	will optimize the results of an indicator, this article first aims
	to determine if there are common approaches in selecting biodiversity
	indicators in ecology and environmental policy. Second, we asked
	which criteria biodiversity indicators were scientifically tested
	against to determine their suitability. To answer these questions,
	we analyzed papers on biodiversity indicators referenced in the Web
	of Science. Our results demonstrate different patterns for selecting
	biodiversity indicators in the different fields of application. In
	ecology, the quality of indicators is mainly determined by a close
	relationship between indicator and indicandum (i.e., indicated phenomenon),
	while the relevance of an indicator for a given issue, e.g., reserve
	selection or an assessment of a certain impact, is of paramount importance
	for conservation policy. Surprisingly, few biodiversity indicators
	are empirically tested to determine if they meet the criteria by
	which they were purportedly chosen. We argue that this is due to
	the different conceptualizations of biodiversity indicators in science
	and environmental policy. Since the suitability of biodiversity indicators
	remains untested in many cases, our findings suggest room to make
	better use of indicators in ecology and environmental policy. As
	the results of ecological research are put to use to solve environmental
	problems, the selection of indicators for ecological research should
	correspond to a large extent with those used in environmental policy.
	Further, to assess the suitability of a biodiversity indicator, it
	should be tested against all of the criteria relevant for its selection.},

	ontogenetic transitions. Such estimations are critical for understanding
	phenotypic plasticity and life-history changes in variable environments,
	assessing genetic changes in the presence of phenotypic plasticity,
	and calibrating size- and age-structured population models. We show
	that previous approaches to this problem, based on regressing size
	against age at maturation, give results that are systematically biased
	when compared to the probabilistic reaction norms. The bias can be
	substantial and is likely to lead to qualitatively incorrect conclusions;
	it is caused by failing to account for the probabilistic nature of
	the maturation process. We explain why, instead, robust estimations
	of maturation reaction norms should be based on logistic regression
	or on other statistical models that treat the probability of maturing
	as a dependent variable. We demonstrate the utility of our approach
	with two examples. First, the analysis of data generated for a known
	reaction norm highlights some crucial limitations of previous approaches.
	Second, application to the northeast arctic cod (Gadus morhua) illustrates
	how our approach can be used to shed new light an existing real-world

	of immature fish maturing at a certain age and size. Knowledge Of
	Such reaction norms is increasingly important, both for observing

	To permit such estimation when measurements of the size and age distribution

	only the size and age distribution of maturing fish, or first-time
	spawners, together with the age-dependent proportion of mature Fish,
	given ill the form of maturity ogives, have to be known. The method
	of Gulland (1964) is used to generate maturity ogives in the absence

	is demonstrated by analysing artificial data generated with a known

	and continuous light from December until next June (LDN/LL), and
	continuous light from June and thereafter natural light from December
	until next June (LL/LDN). All groups were fed the same diet. There
	were small differences in feed conversion ratio (FCR) between groups
	during the first 6-month period of the experiment (June to December).
	In the following 6 months, FCR was highly influenced by the differences
	in rate and pattern of sexual maturation. The FCR was slightly higher
	in the LL/LDN than the LL group in this period. However, the LL/LDN
	group was in the middle of their spawning season when sampled in
	June and the spawning effect on FCR was therefore only partly realised.
	The low FCR of the LL group reflects that cod subjected to continuous
	light did not mature during the experimental period. The sexually
	maturing groups showed tendencies to anemia, with reduced blood hemoglobine
	(HB) concentration and reduced red blood cell count (RBC). The investment
	in gonads resulted in reduced concentrations in plasma cholesterol,
	triacylglycerols (TAG) and glucose, but it did not affect plasma
	total protein concentrations. Whole body dry matter was reduced almost
	linearly as gonads increased, without any correlation towards whole
	body lipid, but strongly correlated to reduced whole body protein
	levels. Cod subjected to regimes LL and LL/LDN showed significant
	postponed spawning. For these groups, no detectable variations in

	(Rhabdosargus sarba) in the lower Swan River Estuary in Western Australia,
	focusing particularly on elucidating the factors influencing the

	annual fecundity. Our results demonstrate that 1) Rhabdosargus sarba
	has indeterminate fecundity, 2) oocyte hydration commences soon after
	dusk (ca. 18:30 h) and is complete by ca. 01:30-04:30 h and 3) fish
	with ovaries containing migratory nucleus oocytes, hydrated oocytes,
	or postovulatory follicles were caught between July and November.
	However, in July and August, their prevalence was low, whereas that
	of fish with ovaries containing substantial numbers of atretic yolk
	granule oocytes was high. Thus, spawning activity did not start to
	peak until September (early spring), when salinities were rising
	markedly from their winter minima. The prevalence of spawning was
	positively correlated with tidal height and was greatest on days
	when the tide changed from flood to ebb at ca. 06:00 h, i.e., just
	after spawning had ceased. Because our estimate of the average daily
	prevalence of spawning by females during the spawning season (July
	to November) was 36.5%, individual females were estimated to spawn,
	on average, at intervals of about 2.7 days and thus about 45 times
	during that period. Therefore, because female R. sarba with total
	lengths of 180, 220, and 260 mm were estimated to have batch fecundities
	of about 4500, 7700, and 12,400 eggs, respectively, they had potential
	annual fecundities of about 204,300, 346,100 and 557,500 eggs, respectively.
	Because spawning occurs just prior to strong ebb tides, the eggs
	of R. sarba are likely to be transported out of the estuary into
	coastal waters where salinities remain at ca. 35%. Such downstream
	transport would account for the fact that, although R. sarba exhibits
	substantial spawning activity in the lower Swan River Estuary, few
	of its early juveniles are recruited into the nearshore shallow waters
	of this estuary.},

	of fish stocks from three sources: the FAO's “State of Marine Resources?,
	a database on scientific stock assessments, and recent estimates
	from statistical models designed to determine the status of unassessed
	fish stocks. The two key results are (i) that stocks that are scientifically
	assessed are in better shape and indeed are not typically declining
	but rebuilding, and (ii) that large stocks appear to be in better
	shape than small stocks. These results support the view that stocks
	that are managed are improving, while stocks that are not managed
	are not. Large stocks receive far more management attention than
	small stocks in jurisdictions that have active fisheries management
	systems, and most unassessed stocks are simply not managed. We assert
	that fisheries management as currently practised can (and often does)
	lead to sustainable fisheries, and what is needed is to actively

  abstract = {The value of big old fat fecund female fish (BOFFFFs) in fostering
	stock productivity and stability has long been underappreciated by
	conventional fisheries science and management, although Hjort (1914)
	indirectly alluded to the importance of maternal effects. Compared
	with smaller mature females, BOFFFFs in a broad variety of marine
	and freshwater teleosts produce far more and often larger eggs that
	may develop into larvae that grow faster and withstand starvation
	better. As (if not more) importantly, BOFFFFs in batch-spawning species
	tend to have earlier and longer spawning seasons and may spawn in
	different locations than smaller females. Such features indicate
	that BOFFFFs are major agents of bet-hedging strategies that help
	to ensure individual reproductive success in environments that vary
	tremendously in time and space. Even if all else were equal, BOFFFFs
	can outlive periods that are unfavourable for successful reproduction
	and be ready to spawn profusely and enhance recruitment when favourable
	conditions return (the storage effect). Fishing differentially removes
	BOFFFFs, typically resulting in severe truncation of the size and
	age structure of the population. In the worst cases, fishing mortality
	acts as a powerful selective agent that inhibits reversal of size
	and age truncation, even if fishing intensity is later reduced. Age
	truncation is now known to destabilize fished populations, increasing
	their susceptibility to collapse. Although some fisheries models
	are beginning to incorporate maternal and other old-growth effects,
	most continue to treat all spawning-stock biomass as identical: many
	small young females are assumed to contribute the same to stock productivity
	as an equivalent mass of BOFFFFs. A growing body of knowledge dictates
	that fisheries productivity and stability would be enhanced if management
	conserved old-growth age structure in fished stocks, be it by limiting
	exploitation rates, by implementing slot limits, or by establishing
	marine reserves, which are now known to seed surrounding fished areas
	via larval dispersal. Networks of marine reserves are likely to be
	the most effective means of ensuring that pockets of old-growth age
	structure survive throughout the geographic range of demersal species.},

  abstract = {The bivalve mollusc Arctica islandica is an important commercial species
	with a presumed parmuctic dispersal strategy, and is widely distributed
	throughout much of the soft sediment benthos of the North Atlantic
	continental shelf. Previous studies have shown that there can be
	gross morphological differences between populations, which has led
	to the suggestion that this may be reflected in genotype. So far,
	only one study has examined the population genetics of this species,
	revealing, depending upon location, that populations are only genetically
	distinct at a macroscale (>1000 km), thereby supporting the assumption
	of panmixia. Examination of the quantitative morphological traits
	between 5 different populations (4 North Sea and 1 Canadian) determined
	that all populations could be readily identified from their unique
	morphologies (shapes/growth patterns) derived from 2 factors resulting
	from a principal components analysis. Investigation, using, random
	amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, into the genetics of the
	populations, to indirectly assess whether the observed phenotypic
	differences could be related to potential differences in genotype,
	revealed that all populations were genetically distinct (between
	populations overall phi(ST) = 0.662) from each other even at a microscale
	(<25 km) (phi(ST) = 0.719). However, no correlation between genetic
	distance, morphological distance and/or geographical distance, whatever
	metric was applied, could be obtained. It is concluded that although
	phenotypic differences can be used to distinguish between populations
	of A. islandica, it should not and cannot be used to infer genetic
	differences in the absence of further studies. What is interesting
	is that the results from the genetic analysis dispute the presumption
	that the dispersal patterns of A. islandica is in any shape or form
	panmictic. This has very important consequences for the management
	of the species. The results are discussed with reference to the possible

	the life history ratios and yield- and spawning-per-recruit. We further
	developed the previously recognized relationship between M/k and
	yield- and spawning-per-recruit by using information on Lm/L∞,
	knife-edge selectivity (Lc/L∞), and the ratio of fishing to natural
	mortality (F/M), to demonstrate the link between an exploited stock's
	expected length composition, and its spawning potential ratio (SPR),
	an internationally recognized measurement of stock status. Variation
	in length-at-age and logistic selectivity patterns were incorporated
	in the model to demonstrate how SPR can be calculated from the observed
	size composition of the catch; an advance which has potential as
	a cost-effective method for assessing data-poor stocks. A companion
	paper investigates the effects of deviations in the main assumptions
	of the model on the application of the analytical models developed
	in this study as a cost-effective method for stock assessment [Hordyk,

	Arrhamphus sclerolepis were described throughout their respective
	ranges in the coastal waters of New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
	Peaks in gonadosomatic indices indicated that spawning of eastern
	sea garfish occurred in late spring and early summer (November-December)
	on the south coast of NSW, and in winter and early spring (June-September)
	on the north coast. Eastern river garfish spawned between July and
	December in NSW estuaries and snub-nosed garfish spawned between
	October and January in the Clarence River. The sex ratios in commercial
	catches of eastern sea garfish from the north coast of NSW were biased
	toward male fish, but approached equality for fish caught from the
	south coast. Sex ratios were significantly biased toward female snub-nosed
	garfish, and female eastern river garfish from all estuaries sampled.
	Mean (+/- SE) batch fecundity was 1498 +/- 110 (range: 98 - 3449)
	ripe oocytes per female for eastern sea garfish, 917 +/- 36 (range:
	102 - 2268) ripe oocytes per female for eastern river garfish, and
	716 +/- 104 (range: 20 - 2956) ripe oocytes per female for snub-nosed
	garfish across the range of mature sizes examined. There was a linear
	relationship between batch fecundity and fish size for all three
	species of garfish. Eastern sea garfish approached 50% maturity at
	a larger size than snub-nosed, or eastern river garfish. Size at
	50% maturity was similar for male and female eastern river and snub-nosed
	garfish, but male eastern sea garfish matured at a significantly
	smaller size than females. All three species appear capable of spawning
	in the spawning season immediately following the one in which they
	were born. Mature female fish of all three species had distributions
	of oocyte diameters consisting of three or four modes, which strongly
	suggests asynchronous oocyte development and a multiple spawning
	strategy during the spawning season. Implications for the management
	of garfish fisheries in NSW are also discussed.},

	the spawning season when the average diameter of the advanced stock

	is determinate. More central California females had atretic advanced
	oocytes than Oregon females, but rates of atresia were not sufficiently
	high to have an important effect on the potential annual fecundity
	of the population. A 1-kg female matured about 83,000 advanced yolked
	oocytes at the beginning of the season. Vitellogenesis continued
	for the advanced yolked oocytes during most of the spawning season
	while batches were repetitively matured and spawned. About nine batches
	were spawned over a six-month spawning season (December-May), and
	spawning ceased when the standing stock of advanced oocytes was exhausted.
	A 1-kg female released about 10,000 eggs per spawning, except for
	the first and last batches which were smaller than the rest. Near
	the end of the season, females may spawn more frequently than earlier
	in the year, increasing the daily production of eggs by the population
	even though fewer females are reproductively active. Annual reproductive
	effort of Dover sole was equivalent to about 14% of body wet weight
	per year. Fifty percent of the females had become sexually mature
	when they reached 332 mm total length. Various methodological issues
	were also treated in this paper, including validation of key assumptions
	underlying estimates of annual fecundity; fecundity sample-size requirements;
	evaluation of criteria and bias in estimating female sexual maturity;

	in the Northwest Atlantic (Newfoundland and Labrador) indicated that
	older individuals of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, of both sexes initiated
	and completed spawning later, and spawned for a greater length of
	time, than younger individuals. Within regions, males were in spawning
	condition for longer periods than females. Among regions, spawning
	duration of males (age = 11 yr) averaged 43.5 +/- 13.6 d and was
	significantly longer than that of females (age = 11 vr; 25.2 +/-
	8.4 d). The strong association between age and time of spawning provides
	empirical evidence of size-specific, assortative mating in cod. The
	decline in recruitment of cod in NAFO Division 2J3KL since 1962 is
	associated with a dramatic reduction in the fecundity contribution
	of older (15-20 yr) relative to younger (7-9 vr) individuals. Our
	results indicate that this increase in proportional abundance of
	younger individuals should be concomitant with a decline in the duration
	of spawning time, reducing the probability that larval emergence
	will match peak abundances of zooplankton, Thus, age dependence of
	maturation and spawning times provides a mechanism by which size-selective
	mortality against larger, older individual, can increase variability

	used a determinate method that estimated annual fecundity as the

	Such fecundity estimates have been (1) reported for populations from
	the Canadian Maritimes to Florida, (2) applied to hypothesis tests
	of life history evolution, and (3) used in demographic models to
	advise management policy. However, American Shad have asynchronous
	development of yolked oocyte clutches, which suggests that new oocytes
	could arise after spawning commences, biasing the results of a determinate
	fecundity method downward. If so, annual fecundity should be a product
	of batch size and the number of batches—an indeterminate fecundity
	method. We investigated oocyte recruitment, atresia, and spawning
	intervals using gonad histology of females from the Mattaponi River,
	Virginia. Batch size (i.e., the number of hydrated oocytes prior
	to a spawning event) was estimated using a gravimetric method. Spawning
	duration was obtained from an independent acoustic tagging study.
	A size hiatus between primary and secondary oocytes was only evident
	in some individuals during spawning, so we conclude that an indeterminate
	fecundity method is necessary for this population of American Shad.
	Atresia was evident during spawning but was low at the end of the
	2002 spawning season. Females spawned every 2.2–2.9 d, releasing
	11–17 batches per season. Batch fecundity (range: 12,700–81,400)

	(95% confidence interval), about double the previous (determinate)
	estimates from this river system (260,000 and 288,000). Until more

  abstract = {Underwater visual surveys are frequently used in monitoring programmes
	of marine populations. Species occupancy, defined as the probability
	of presence in a sampling unit, is a commonly used state variable.
	Imperfect detectability is a serious issue in such studies and, if
	ignored, may lead to incorrect inferences and erroneous management
	decisions. In this paper, we propose a methodology and field protocol
	for underwater visual surveys implemented by multiple observers.
	This approach can be applied for an unbiased occupancy estimation
	of marine species by explicitly incorporating imperfect detection
	into the modelling process. Based on a case study carried out in
	a Greek coastal area (Saronikos Gulf), the benefits of the proposed
	approach were demonstrated. Using a sufficient number of observers,
	the probability of recording false absences (i.e. the probability
	that the target species was present in a site but not detected) was
	minimized and occupancy estimation was greatly improved. For the
	whelk Stramonita haemastoma in the case study area, single-observer
	occupancy estimates were negatively biased and varied significantly
	(between 0.64 and 0.89) depending on the observer, while with the
	proposed methodology, using 5 observers, the obtained occupancy estimate
	had the value of 0.93. The probability of false absence was high
	in the single-observer case (between 0.10 and 0.30), and rather low
	with any combination of 3 observers (<0.025), while it dropped to
	practically 0 with 5 observers. As demonstrated in the case of the
	alien green alga Codium fragile fragile, occupancy models provide
	a flexible framework for relating occupancy to spatial and environmental
	covariates, testing ecological hypotheses and producing predictive
	distributional maps. Overall, the presented methodology and its potential
	extensions could prove extremely useful in a variety of applications

	Arctic stock of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The model predicts that
	skipped spawning is a regular phenomenon, with up to 30% of the sexually
	mature biomass skipping spawning. Spawning should be skipped if the
	expected future gain in reproductive output, discounted by survival,
	more than balances the expected reproductive success the current
	year. Skipped spawning was most common (i) among potential second-time
	spawners and (ii) early in life, (iii) when fishing mortality at
	the spawning grounds was high, (iv) when fishing mortality at the
	feeding grounds was low, (v) when natural mortality was low, and
	(vi) when the energetic and mortality costs associated with migration
	and spawning were high. Cod skipped spawning more often when food
	availability was both increased (opportunities for better growth)
	and decreased (too little energy for gonad development), and this
	pattern interacted with mortality rate. We conclude that skipped
	spawning may be more widespread than appreciated and highlight potential

	correlated with fish size, and varied between 0.44 and 1.67 million
	eggs. Parasites, previously unreported to occur in wahoo gonads and

	(poor data) or limited data (data poor) is extremely important. Hierarchical
	Bayesian methods are especially applicable to small-area, small-sample-size

	strength from species with good-quality data. We used a hammerhead
	shark complex as an example to investigate the advantages of using
	hierarchical Bayesian models in assessing the status of poor-data
	and data-poor exploited species. The hammerhead shark complex (Sphyrna
	spp.) along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United
	States is composed of three species: the scalloped hammerhead (S.
	lewini), the great hammerhead (S. mokarran), and the smooth hammerhead
	(S. zygaena) sharks. The scalloped hammerhead comprises 70-80% of
	the catch and has catch and relative abundance data of good quality,
	whereas great and smooth hammerheads have relative abundance indices
	that are both limited and of low quality presumably because of low
	stock density and limited sampling. Four hierarchical Bayesian state-space
	surplus production models were developed to simulate variability
	in population growth rates, carrying capacity, and catchability of
	the species. The results from the hierarchical Bayesian models were
	considerably more robust than those of the nonhierarchical models.
	The hierarchical Bayesian approach represents an intermediate strategy
	between traditional models that assume different population parameters
	for each species and those that assume all species share identical
	parameters. Use of the hierarchical Bayesian approach is suggested
	for future hammerhead shark stock assessments and for modeling fish
	complexes with species-specific data, because the poor-data species
	can borrow strength from the species with good data, making the estimation
	more stable and robust.},

	Zoological Studies 43(2): 229-243. Parasitic copepods are common
	on cultured and wild marine finfish, and there is a substantive literature
	describing their taxonomy, life cycles, and host ranges. Although
	many species have long been recognized to have the potential to affect
	the growth, fecundity, and survival of their hosts, it has only been
	with the development of semi-intensive and intensive aquaculture
	that their importance as disease-causing agents has become evident.
	Members of the family Caligidae are the most commonly reported species
	on fish reared in brackish and marine waters. These species, often
	referred to as sea lice, are responsible for most disease outbreaks.
	The impacts of sea lice on marine salmonid aquaculture are well documented,
	with catastrophic losses reported for disease outbreaks that have
	resulted in high levels of mortality. With the development of a variety
	of treatments and management strategies to reduce infection levels,
	mortality caused by sea lice has been greatly reduced. At present,
	economic losses due to sea lice are primarily from the costs of treatments,
	the costs of the management strategies, the costs associated with
	reduced growth rates that are a direct result of infection and/or
	treatment, and the costs of carcass downgrading at harvest. Indirect
	and direct losses due to sea lice in salmonid aquaculture globally
	are estimated to be greater than US$100 million annually. In other
	areas of marine aquaculture, the impact of parasitic copepods is
	not well documented. This is especially true for species such as
	Atlantic halibut, Atlantic cod, turbot, and haddock that have only
	recently entered commercial-scale production. This review discusses
	the global importance of parasitic copepods as disease-causing agents
	in marine aquaculture. We also provide a brief review of the environmental
	and husbandry factors that may affect parasitic copepod abundance
	and the potential roles that parasitic copepods play as vectors for
	other disease agents.},

	the initial phase (IP) immediately prior to maturity. IP males have
	high testes weights relative to terminal phase (TP) males and appear
	to be functionally analogous to primary males. They grow at the same
	rate as normal protogynous hermaphrodites (which change sex and color
	almost synchronously) but tend to change color at a smaller size
	and may have a better survival rate. The spawning season lasts from
	late July until the end of November, and sex change occurs between
	November and May. Color change is often slightly delayed with respect
	to sex change over this period. Some IP males appear to change color
	during the spawning season. Growth is slower at Wellington during
	the first year only and is associated with a much larger recruitment.
	As a consequence maturity, which is reached during the 0+ year at
	Leigh, is largely delayed until the 2+ year at Wellington. In both
	areas, maturity is at a critical size of 100-110 mm SL, although
	slightly smaller for IP males. Although actual densities are higher
	at Wellington, the effective densities are ≈13 per 500 m2 at both
	areas. Normal sex/color change occurs at a significantly larger size
	at Leigh. However, because of the growth difference, changes occur
	at a younger age. The average mature female phase is a year shorter
	at Wellington. There are only 3.7 mature females to each TP male
	at Leigh, as opposed to 8.7 at Wellington. However, because females
	are smaller at Wellington, the mean weight of ripe ovary available
	to each TP male is similar. Sex change and color change are always
	more closely related to size than age, as are maturity and fecundity.
	The results are discussed in relation to preliminary observations
	of social behavior, and Warner's (1975a) model predicting the optimal

	July and just prior to spawning were 0.4 and 3.2, respectively. The
	corresponding figures for females were 2.8 and 28.6. 4. Gonadal energy
	contents per unit tissue mass were estimated to be higher in females

	After spawning the gonadal energy contents were 280 kJ and 385 kJ

	protein contents of somatic, visceral and gonadal tissues were highly
	correlated with percentage tissue water. 6. Total energy loss due
	to migration and spawning was between 60% and 70% of the body reserves
	prior to upstream migration. It was similar for males and females,
	but higher in large than small salmon. Estimated energy investment
	due to reproduction correlated significantly with estimated survival
	rates in 12 Norwegian populations of Atlantic salmon.},

  abstract = {Age-related variations in chemical composition of egg matter were
	found in females in some studies, but they do not seem to be a universal
	phenomenon. In contrast, egg size can be well predicted from female
	age. The relationship has a parabolic shape, but the predicted size
	decrease of eggs from old females has not always been documented.
	Female size is an important contributor to egg size, both at intra-
	and inter-specific levels. Dependence of fecundity on body size has
	usually been described by a power function. A trade-off between egg
	number and size is considered in light of life history strategies.
	During a spawning season egg size may differ between successive batches,
	but lack of effects of egg batch sequence was reported in some studies.
	In yolk-feeding fish three discrete periods of elevated mortality
	are typically observed: shortly after egg activation, during hatching,
	and at final yolk resorption. The positive relationships between
	female size, egg size and offspring size/resistance to starvation
	and predation are a key pathway in parent-egg-progeny relationships.
	Both maternal and paternal effects contribute to the total survival
	of offspring, but they operate in different ways and at different
	times. In contrast to the importance of female size, no paternal
	size effects were revealed, but density and motility of spermatozoans
	were decisive. Typically, paternal effects diminish earlier in ontogeny.
	Major factors governing embryonic survival (fertilisation success
	and hatching success) differ from factors to which starvation mortality
	of yolk-feeding larvae is related. Embryonic survival is affected
	by female age via egg matter composition, by egg ripeness and paternal
	factors such as sperm density and motility. In contrast, starvation
	mortality of yolk-feeding larvae depends largely on female attributes
	(age, size and fecundity) via egg size, and, in some batch spawners,
	on egg batch sequence. Among teleost species egg size varies across
	a wide range (from 0.3 to 85-90 mm in diameter). Species that spawn
	large eggs are relatively rare. Caloric value of egg dry matter varies
	within a narrow range of 20-30 J mg(-1). Ecosystem and evolutionary
	components, and reproductive style are factors that contribute to
	egg endowment and yolk quality. During the last decade considerable
	progress was made in the methodology and understanding of paternal
	effect on progeny performance in fishes. This paper reviews these
	of parent-egg-progeny relationships.},

  abstract = {For a period of 1 year, some blood parameters were evaluated on a
	monthly basis in a population of adult European sea bass (Dicentrarchus
	labrax L.) intensively reared in floating marine cages (Ionian Sea,
	Mediterranean). From April (13 months old) to July (16 months old)
	males (35-50%) and sexually indeterminate individuals were collected.
	From August to March (24 months old) only males were sampled. During
	this period the percentage of spermiated males was highest (100%)
	from November (20 months old) to January (22 months old). Plasma
	testosterone in males was inversely related to sunlight (h month(-1))
	and was elevated between October and January, when males first achieved
	sexual maturity. Testosterone showed the highest value (0.49 +/-
	0.02 ng ml(-1)) in January and the lowest (0.09 +/- 0.02 ng ml(-1))
	in March. Haematocrit, red blood cell counts and haemoglobin concentration
	were elevated from November to March, being inversely related to
	sunlight. The two latter parameters were also inversely related to
	daily food intake. Haematocrit, red blood cell counts and haemoglobin
	concentration were highest in December [53 +/- 1%, (5.36 +/- 0.06)
	x 10(6) mm(-3), 10.08 +/- 0.14 g 100 ml(-1), respectively] and lowest
	in June [35 +/- 1%, (3.33 +/- 0.05) x 10(6) mm(-3), 6.47 +/- 0.13
	g 100 ml(-1), respectively]. White blood cell counts were not correlated
	with sea water temperature, sunlight or daily food intake. They were
	highest in February [(8.45 +/- 0.20) x 10(4) mm(-3)] and lowest in
	April [(6.07 +/- 0.14) x 10(4) mm(-3)]. Total plasma protein concentration
	(4.88 +/- 0.11-5.93 +/- 0.10 g 100 ml(-1)) and mean cell volume (93.3
	+/- 0.9-105.5 +/- 1.8 mum(3)) showed small fluctuations throughout
	the year. Sexual maturity appears to be a major factor that significantly
	affects haemopoiesis of D. labrax. This study contributes to the
	evaluation of normal levels of some blood parameters in European
	sea bass, which are helpful for the assessment of physiological status
	and health of this species.},

	is correlated to the size advantage. Furthermore, we find that transitions
	from sex change to dioecy are less likely under stronger size advantage.
	We cannot determine, however, how the size advantage affects transitions
	from dioecy to sex change. Finally, contrary to what is generally
	expected, we find that transitions from dioecy to sex change are
	more likely than transitions from sex change to dioecy. The similarity

  abstract = {I examine how the population biology of pelagic copepods depends on
	their mating biology using field data and a simple demographic model.
	Among calanoid copepods, two distinct patterns emerge. Firstly, copepods
	that lack seminal receptacle and require repeated mating to stay
	fertilized have near equal adult sex ratios in field populations.
	Winter population densities are orders of magnitude less than the
	critical population density required for population persistence,
	but populations survive winter seasons as resting eggs in the sediment.
	Population growth in these species is potentially high because they
	have on average a factor of 2 higher egg production rates than other
	pelagic copepods. Secondly, other copepods require only one mating
	to stay fertile, and populations of these species have strongly female-skewed
	adult sex-ratios in field populations. Resting eggs have not been
	described within this group. Winter population sizes are well predicted
	by the critical density required for population persistence which,
	in turn, is closely related to the body-size-dependent mate-search
	capacity. Thus, the different requirements for mating lead in the
	first case to a more opportunistic reproductive strategy that implies
	rapid colonization of the pelagic during productive seasons, and
	in the second case to a strategy that allows maintenance of a pelagic
	populations during unproductive seasons. Positive density dependent
	population growth during periods of low population density ('Allee
	effect') amplifies population density variation during winter into
	the subsequent summer, thus explaining why summer densities appear
	to depend more on winter densities than on current growth opportunities
	in pelagic copepods.},

	classification. This model allows the calculation of two standardized
	relative abundance indices: 1) direct interpretation of regression
	coefficients for the year category, and 2) the usual estimates of
	c.p.u.e. calculated using standardized effort (adjusted c.p.u.e.).
	The regression coefficient estimates have advantages in theoretical
	simplicity and computational convenience.The model is applied to
	two trawl-fished populations of Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus)
	in the northeast Pacific. Catch and effort data from 1953 to 1976
	were used to calculate relative abundance indices standardized for
	gross tonnage, echo sounders with paper recorders, and roller (bobbin)
	gear. Stock conditions for the two populations have been historically
	different, and this factor is shown to interact with the impact of
	technological improvements. In the Queen Charlotte Sound region,
	where stocks have been and remain in relatively good condition, technological
	improvements had little measurable effect on catch rates. However,
	in the west Vancouver Island region, where stocks have been smaller
	and are now depleted, these same technological improvements (echo
	sounders with paper recorders and roller gear) doubled the estimated
	efficiency of vessels.Due principally to catches by large Japanese
	and Soviet trawlers, relative abundance indices in both the Charlotte
	and Vancouver regions registered a sharp decline (50% and greater)
	in 1965 to 1968. This decline was particularly severe in the Vancouver
	region. In the Charlotte region, relative abundance measured by regression
	coefficient estimates and adjusted c.p.u.e.s were nearly identical;
	but in the Vancouver region, these estimates differed. Considering
	the methods used in calculation, it was concluded that this difference
	was probably due to chance events rather than systematic bias.The
	use of a qualifying criterion for selecting data (deleting data for
	which the catch is below some fixed percentage of the study species)
	can greatly affect estimates of relative abundance in multi-species
	fisheries. In the Charlotte region, a qualifying percentage of 25
	% had little effect on relative abundance estimates. But for the
	Vancouver region, a qualifying percentage of 25 % significantly lessened
	the estimated decline in abundance.In summary, it appears that there
	is generally an interaction between the effects of technological
	improvements in a fishing fleet and the condition of fish stocks.
	It appears that technological improvements sometimes have their greatest
	measurable impact on fully utilized or depleted stocks. Also, the
	selection of qualification levels will sometimes be critical when
	measuring large declines in stock abundance.},

	These predictions, however, focused on total reproductive effort
	and did not distinguish between a response in offspring size and
	clutch size. Here, we model how specific paternal effects on fitness
	affect maternal allocation to offspring size and number. The specific
	mechanism by which males affect the fitness of females or their offspring
	determines whether and how females allocated differentially. Offspring
	size is predicted to increase when males benefit offspring survival,
	but decrease when males increase offspring growth rate. Clutch size
	is predicted to increase when males contribute to female resources
	(e.g. with a nuptial gift) and when males increase offspring growth
	rate. The predicted direction and magnitude of female responses vary
	with female age, but only when per-offspring paternal benefits decline
	with clutch size. We conclude that considering specific paternal
	effects on fitness in the context of maternal life-history trade-offs
	can help explain mixed empirical patterns of differential allocation

	technique, has so far received little attention within fish fecundity
	studies, although it can be used to provide unbiased, assumption-free
	data on levels of atresia (resorption of vitellogenic oocytes). In
	comparison, traditional simple counting to estimate the numerical
	ratio of normal to atretic cells is biased because the smaller atretic
	cells have a lower chance of being transected in histological sections.
	These problems are circumvented by the disector method as it operates
	in three dimensions, i.e., uses consecutive pairs of slides. However,
	the high labour costs involved prevent regular usage of this method
	in population studies where large numbers of ovarian samples are
	processed. In the present paper we assess the corresponding bias
	of the traditional profile method, analysing developing ovaries of
	Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and herring (Clupea harengus), i.e.,

	A highly significant but non-linear relationship (r(2) = 0.975, P
	< 0.001, df = 154) was found between the relative intensity of atretic
	vitellogenic oocytes (A(RI)) estimated by the disector and profile

	none of the fish showed the so-called circumnuclear ring (CNR; rich

  abstract = {Abstract: Flatfish and groundfish show many similarities in reproductive
	strategies and tactics, both in types present and in responses to
	fishing pressure or changes in their environment. Over the last 20â€“30Â years
	the reproduction of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus
	hippoglossus, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, sole Solea solea, and
	turbot Scophthalmus maximus have been extensively studied in the
	North Atlantic. For cod, halibut and turbot, the research has progressed
	rapidly due to interest from the aquaculture industry. Extensive
	overexploitation over many years in combination with climate change
	represents a potential evolutionary pressure towards changes in growth,
	lower age at maturity, increased fecundity, smaller egg size (and
	thereby larval size) and change in spawning time. Early sexual maturity/precocious
	maturation is also seen in aquaculture and is problematic economically
	due to a reduction in fillet production. In this paper information
	is reviewed from studies on both wild and captive populations in
	experiments, the latter considered important because overexploitation,
	such as observed in the North Sea, often reduces the natural dynamics
	in growth and reproduction and complicates collection of sufficiently
	large samples. Evidence from laboratory experiments demonstrates
	the inherent plasticity of fecundity production and how this is controlled
	by food availability and length of photoperiod, while recent information
	from field studies demonstrates the evolution of genotypes in response
	to fishing mortality. Today several laboratories have adopted modern
	techniques for analysis of reproductive investments (fecundity, atresia
	and sperm characterisation) in controlled experimental situations
	to explore the effect of temperature or other environmental parameters
	(such as salinity) on reproduction. These developments, in combination
	with the rapid implementation of molecular techniques, should make
	it possible in the ...},

  abstract = {Sexually mature Arcto-Norwegian female cod, Gadus morhua, were sampled
	off northern Norway either during spawning migration (Vesteralen)
	or at spawning sites (Lofoten) from 1986 to 1996. This period comprised
	a dramatic, nearly cyclical change in the Barents Sea ecosystem.
	The stock of the main food item, viz. the Barents Sea capelin Mallotus
	villosus villosus, changed from a low (1986), to a high (1991) and
	again to a low (1994) level of abundance while the climate changed
	from a cold (less than or equal to 1989) to a warm regime. The relative
	annual potential fecundity (i.e. number of vitellogenic oocytes per
	g prespawning fish) increased by approximately 40% from 1987 to 1991.
	However, information from a back-calculation technique calibrated
	in the laboratory using spawning fish indicated that this change
	might have been as high as 80 to 90%. Ovaries were analysed by the
	gravimetric, the automated particle counting and the stereometric
	method (modified to use with ovaries too large to section whole).
	All three methods gave similar fecundity estimates. The latter method
	was applied to quantify atresia of developing oocytes in the good-condition
	year of 1991. Atresia was rare, occurring in only 30% of the ovaries
	and where it was present in only 1 to 4% of the vitellogenic oocytes.
	Spawning females sampled from 1991 to 1996 gradually produced fewer
	eggs and demonstrated clear interannual variations in vitellogenic
	oocyte mean size and distribution thought to reflect a delicate reproductive
	tactic to minimise negative nutritional effects on egg size and egg
	quality. Estimates of annual potential fecundity for the duration
	of the study were significantly positively correlated with environmental
	temperature and the availability of capelin during vitellogenesis.

	Atlantic Canada to eastern Maine, exhibits characteristics conducive
	to the study of CSP. Previous studies have shown that gametic incompatibility

	to that seen in non-competitive fertilizations, in five of the twelve
	crosses in which conspecific crosses were detectable. This is the
	first finding of CSP in a naturally hybridizing population of a free-spawning
	marine invertebrate. Our findings support earlier predictions that
	CSP can promote assortative fertilization in bimodal hybrid zones,
	further advancing their hypothesized progression towards full speciation.
	Despite strong CSP numerous heterospecific fertilizations remain,

	The only exception is Champsocephalus gunnari at South Georgia which

	Zone more species spawn in summer and autumn. Spawning time is remarkably
	constant among populations of some species, in others a latitudinal
	shift in spawning time is apparent. Fecundity is commonly positively
	correlated with fish length and weight. It exceeds 100 000 eggs only

	to 15-20 000 eggs. Ova diameter varies from 0.8 to 5.0 mm. Egg size

	size of wild fish was obscure in same-season comparisons, probably
	because of the temperature effect on egg size. Common-environment
	experiments conducted at three temperatures showed that egg size
	decreased with increasing temperature in all populations. In the

	populations at all temperatures, showing clear latitudinal clines.
	Females from low latitude spawned larger eggs at every experimental

	females from high latitude. Thus, the northern fish had a larger
	reproductive output per spawning and a larger number of smaller eggs
	in a spawning. Such interpopualtion variation in this fish is likely
	to be partially genetically based, although environmental effects
	on the variation cannot be entirely ruled out. This study provides

	We found that the ancestral large-bodied cichlids first increased

	resulting in the common current combination of a small-bodied cichlid
	with a small clutch of large eggs. Furthermore, lineages that deviated
	from the negative relationship between clutch and egg size underwent
	different transitions in these traits according to their body size
	(large bodied genera have moved towards the large clutch/small egg
	end of the continuum and small bodied genera towards the small clutch/large

	of selective advantage. Environmental variability seems to be a key
	factor governing the pay-off of brood size adjustment. However, in

	ensures not only the establishment of competitive asymmetries among
	chicks, but also significantly reduces the impact of predation on

	evolve when the daily risk of predation is high, provided that the

	beneficial when the probability of hatching failure is high. This
	suggests, that the addition of surplus eggs to the clutch to track
	environmental fluctuations from one hand, and to insure against hatching
	failure from the other hand, seem likely to act jointly to favor
	larger clutches. The model also predicts that even if costs of brood

	demography like distribution, abundance, migration, population structure,
	and factors affecting survival are presented. The historic range
	of the harbour porpoise extended into the north-eastern parts of
	the Baltic Sea. During the second half of the 20(th) century, numbers
	of harbour porpoises have declined and the distribution range narrowed.
	Currently there is a considerable difference in abundance in the
	Kattegat and Belt Sea (0.73 - 0.99 animals km(-2)) as opposed to
	the Baltic Proper (<0.01 animals km(-2)). Although recent morphometric,

	Sea are somewhat inconsistent with respect to population structure,
	the existence of a distinct Baltic subpopulation appears to be a

	ambiguous. In historic times large numbers of harbour porpoises were
	hunted in the Danish straits during winter and spring. Therefore
	it was often concluded that porpoises escaped from ice cover in the
	eastern Baltic Sea in the winter and re-colonised the Baltic Proper
	in spring. Recent observations indicate that migration behaviour
	is much more complex and diffuse. There seems to be a tendency of
	animals from the Kattegat to migrate into the North Sea during winter.
	But also animals remaining in the western Baltic or Baltic Proper
	have been described. Available nutritional studies suggest that harbour
	porpoises take a variety of different prey. Herring, sprat and cod
	are their most important prey items. Sexual maturity is attained
	at an age of 3 - 4 years. A larger proportion of females give birth
	to one calf every year (pregnancy rates were reported between 0.61
	and 0.84). The average life span. of harbour porpoises in the Baltic
	Sea is unknown. From existing data, a maximum age of 22 to 23 years
	seems to be a realistic assumption. However, a high mortality in
	the first years of age and a proportion of less than 5% of the animals
	living beyond 12 years have a significant impact on the potential
	for increase of the stocks. It is assumed that shallow areas play
	an important role for this species with respect to calving and nursing.
	A variety of studies report heavy attacks from parasites such as
	Anisakis simplex, Tonyurus convolutus, Stenurus minor, Halocercus
	invaginatus or Pseudalisus inflexus. However, when compared to samples
	from Greenland these can be regarded as normal infestations. Environmental
	contaminants most likely affect the long-term viability of Baltic
	Sea harbour porpoise stocks and might have been a major cause for
	the decline of Baltic Sea harbour porpoise stocks between the 1940s
	and the 1970s. Since then concentrations of PCBs and other organochlorine
	contaminants have declined. To date, the most important threat to
	Baltic Sea harbour porpoises is by-catch. Noise pollution has the
	potential to increasingly become a major threat due to the development
	of new activities in the Baltic Sea (offshore-windpower plants, fast
	ferries, etc.). This study lists a number of life history variables
	for which data is urgently needed. On the basis of the currently
	available knowledge, an effective management strategy must include
	political and technical means of mitigating threatening activities
	such as by-catch, disturbance to critical habitat, disposal of contaminants
	and over-fishing. In this respect it is important to establish marine
	protected areas and time- and area closures for certain fisheries
	which are likely to be unsustainable, to establish mandatory fishery
	observer programmes and to compile appropriate fisheries statistics.},

	I use a simple SR model to show that the ability to characterize
	a SR relationship depends upon both natural mortality (M) during
	the prerecruit period, which is associated with a species' fecundity
	(F), and the variability of M. The SR relationship may be readily
	determined in species with low fecundities (e.g. higher vertebrates:
	F less-than-or-similar-to 10), even if the variability of M is relatively
	high. However, the SR relationship generally cannot be defined in
	species, such as teleosts, with high fecundities (F on the order
	of 10(6)) if prerecruit M exhibits even moderate variability because
	small variations in M lead to large changes in survivorship. Thus,
	the concept of a simple deterministic SR relationship does not appear
	applicable to organisms with high fecundities. The use of fishery
	population models dependent upon such functions needs to be reexamined.
	Adaptive management strategies (i.e experimental manipulations of

	similar to their hosts in body size and parasitize larger hosts than
	do ejectors, which parasitize hosts much smaller than themselves.
	In both types of parasite, the cuckoo's egg tends to match the host
	eggs in size. To achieve this, nonejectors have evolved a smaller
	egg for their body size than have nonparasitic cuckoos, and ejectors
	have evolved an even smaller egg. Among ejector cuckoo genera, larger
	cuckoos have larger eggs relative to the eggs of their hosts, and
	the relationship between cuckoo egg volume (mass of the newly-hatched
	cuckoo) and host egg volume (mass to be ejected) did not differ from
	that predicted by weight-lifting allometry. However, comparing among
	Cuculus cuckoo species, the allometric slope differed from the predicted,

	most speciose ejector genera, Chrysococcyx cuckoos (smaller and parasitize

	eggs than do Cuculus cuckoos (larger and parasitize open cup-nesting

	the following: (1) selection to reduce adult body mass to facilitate
	entry through small domed nest holes to lay, and (2) less need for
	a large egg, because longer incubation periods in dome-nesting hosts
	allow the young cuckoo more time to grow before it need eject host

  abstract = {This paper explores why the [`]Auto-diametric method', currently used
	in many laboratories to quickly estimate fish fecundity, works well
	on marine species with a determinate reproductive style but much
	less so on species with an indeterminate reproductive style. Algorithms
	describing links between potentially important explanatory variables
	to estimate fecundity were first established, and these were followed
	by practical observations in order to validate the method under two
	extreme situations: 1) straightforward fecundity estimation in a
	determinate, single-batch spawner: Atlantic herring (AH) Clupea harengus
	and 2) challenging fecundity estimation in an indeterminate, multiple-batch
	spawner: Japanese flounder (JF) Paralichthys olivaceus. The Auto-diametric
	method relies on the successful prediction of the number of vitellogenic
	oocytes (VTO) per gram ovary (oocyte packing density; OPD) from the
	mean VTO diameter. Theoretically, OPD could be reproduced by the
	following four variables; ODV (volume-based mean VTO diameter, which
	deviates from arithmetic mean VTO diameter), VFvto (volume fraction
	of VTO in the ovary), [rho]o (specific gravity of the ovary) and
	k (VTO shape, i.e. ratio of long and short oocyte axes). VFvto, [rho]o
	and k were tested in relation to growth in ODV. The dynamic range
	throughout maturation was clearly highest in VFvto. As a result,
	OPD was mainly influenced by ODV and secondly by VFvto. Log (OPD)
	for AH decreased as log (ODV) increased, while log (OPD) for JF first
	increased during early vitellogenesis, then decreased during late
	vitellogenesis and spawning as log (ODV) increased. These linear
	regressions thus behaved statistically differently between species,
	and associated residuals fluctuated more for JF than for AH. We conclude
	that the OPD-ODV relationship may be better expressed by several
	curves that cover different parts of the maturation cycle rather
	than by one curve that cover all these parts. This seems to be particularly
	true for indeterminate spawners. A correction factor for vitellogenic
	atresia was included based on the level of atresia and the size of
	atretic oocytes in relation to normal oocytes finding that OPD would
	be biased when smaller atretic oocytes are present but not accounted
	for. Furthermore, special care should be taken when collecting sub-samples
	to make them as representative as possible of the whole ovary, including
	in terms of relative amount of ovarian wall and stroma. Theoretical
	consideration, along with original, high-quality information regarding
	the above-listed variables made it possible to reproduce very accurately
	the observed changes in OPD, but not yet precisely enough at the
	individual level in indeterminate spawners.},

	in February/March. Both prevalence of atresia (portion of fish with

	with atresia) were highest in October and November, i.e., following

	1-10 eggs. The average size of clutch and brood is smaller in late
	than early broods, and smaller in England than in Switzerland (tables
	1 and 2). 2. Each nestling is fed less often in a brood of large
	than one of small size (table 3), and the few data on nestling weights
	support this view (table 5). 3. The percentage of eggs which produce
	fledged young is closely similar for broods of all the ordinary sizes
	found in nature (table 4). 4. Among Starlings which survive at least
	three months after leaving the nest, the recovery-rate is lower for
	young from broods of above average size than it is for young from
	broods of average size or smaller (tables 6, 8 and 10). Correspondingly,
	for Starlings dying within two months of leaving the nest, the recovery
	rate is higher for young from broods above average size than for
	young from broods of smaller size (tables 7 and 9). These differences
	hold for both early and late broods, and for Switzerland, Britain,
	and Holland. In only two cases are the differences statistically
	significant, but all of the seven possible analyses give concordant
	answers. 5. These results imply that, in the first two months after
	leaving the nest, the mortality-rate is higher among the young from
	broods of large than small size. As a result, broods with one or
	two more young than the average give rise to about the same number
	of descendants as broods of average size, i.e., broods of these sizes
	are about equally efficient. 6. The smaller size of late than first
	clutches, and of British than Swiss clutches, is considered to be
	advantageous; since in each case the mortality-rate rises as soon
	as brood-size exceeds the commonest size found in nature. 7. Annual
	differences in average clutchsize are small (table 11). Had there
	been extensive non-genetic modifications, the apparent rise in mortality-rate
	with brood-size would have been obscured. 8. Each individual tends
	to lay a clutch of similar (but not necessarily identical) size in
	different years (Appendix I). 9. Two individuals from the same brood
	are recovered rather more frequently than would be expected by chance
	(table 12). 10. Swiss Starlings appear to have a higher average annual
	mortality-rate than British Starlings (table 13). This is an inevitable
	consequence of the higher reproductive rate of the former.},

	energy losses, and postspawning condition of Atlantic cod (Gadus
	morhua) was examined under the hypothesis that females, in response
	to lower available energy reserves, would reduce reproductive investment
	in order to limit somatic energy losses. Laboratory experiments revealed
	that female cod with high prespawning condition factors ended reproduction
	in better condition than females with low prespawning condition factors.
	Fecundity and total egg dry weight were significantly lower in poor-condition

	experienced by females in good condition. Consequently, energy reserves
	invested in reproduction by poor-condition females increase their
	risk of mortality. In the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence during the
	early 1990s, reproductive females had lower fecundities and were
	in worse prespawning and postspawning condition. The condition of
	spent females suggested a greater impact of changes in environmental

	was investigated by macroscopic and histological analyses of the
	gonads. Fish samples were collected in tide pools at Tristan da Cunha
	in July 2004. Most specimens of both sexes were developing, or sexually
	mature, with a gonadosomatic index (GSI) of 7.0-9.2% in females and
	0.2-0.6% in males. Histologically, testes showed a random distribution
	of spermatogonia along the lobules, a condition defined as the unrestricted
	spermatogonial type. Ripe males exhibited lobules with all spermatogenic
	stages of development from spermatogonia to spermatozoa. In mature
	females, the ovarian follicles consisted of three main cohorts of
	oocytes of different sizes; the smaller one represented by previtellogenic
	oocytes of 15-150 mu m and the other two by yolked oocytes measuring,
	respectively, 300-1000 and 800-1500 mu m. The overlap between the
	stock of advanced yolked oocytes and the early yolked oocytes was
	low, decreasing progressively with final maturation. As a result,
	B. diacanthus was considered a batch spawner, with a spawning season
	extending from July to August onward. Batch fecundity, based on the
	most advanced yolked oocytes, was 2,047-8,317 mature oocytes/female,
	whereas the relative fecundity was 77-141 mature oocytes/g. In the
	light of the phyletically basal position of bovichtids in the suborder,
	the reproductive traits of B. diacanthus were compared with those
	previously described in other Antarctic and non-Antarctic notothenioids.},

	35 cm TL, very similar to that obtained indirectly for males. Similar
	to many other high-Antarctic fish, C. hamatus is a summer spawner.
	The greater part of the stock was indeed in spawning condition between
	December and February, although a large proportion of females large
	enough to spawn probably did not spawn in that season. The present
	data confirm that C. hamatus, as is typical for Antarctic fish, probably
	spawns a single batch of oocytes once a year. In addition, vitellogenesis
	is a slow process that extends over at least 1 year. Discrepancies
	between the macroscopic and histological appearance of gonads were
	found. These were associated mainly with spent and resting females
	(maturity stages 5 and 2, respectively). This study demonstrates
	the importance of histological analysis of gonads in order to confirm
	the results of the macroscopic analyses routinely carried out in

	As originally proposed, the approach assumed that points above a

	fishes; in some groups the testes are composite with an anterior
	part formed of spermatogenetic tissues and the posterior part of
	seminal vesicles which may or may not store spermatozoa. For catfish
	species of aquacultural interest, ovaries present the same general
	morphology as in other teleosts with oviducts. Spermatozoa are biflagellated
	in the Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and monoflagellated
	in the European catfish (Silurus glanis) and African catfishes (Clarias
	gariepinus, Heterobranchus longifilis). The egg size shows considerable
	intergroup differences, from 0.8-1.2 mm in some Pimelodidae and Clariidae
	up to 15-20 mm in Ariidae. In numerous cases, the eggs are adhesive
	and develop either a surrounding sticky layer (Ictalurus, Chrysichthys,
	Silurus) or an adhesive attachment disc (Clarias, Heterobranchus).
	Fertilization is in general external but internal fertilization is
	reported in some species. The annual sperm production was measured
	in European catfish and Channel catfish as 1.7 x 10(11) and 1.8 x
	10(10) spermatozoa.kg(-1) body weight, respectively. In females,
	the fecundity ranges from about 50 eggs per spawn in ariids up to
	more than 100000 eggs.kg(-1) body weight, e.g. in pimelodids and
	clariids. A large variety of controlled reproduction systems are
	found in the siluroids. In some cases (Ictalurus, Chrysichthys, Hoplosternum),
	spawning occurs naturally in ponds or tanks provided that adequate
	spawning substrates are available; fertilized eggs are collected
	immediately after spawning and placed into incubators until hatching.
	But for most species, although natural or seminatural spawning could
	be achieved in captivity, the tendency at the present time is to
	develop techniques using hormonal-induced ovulation and artificial
	insemination in order to control the various steps of reproduction
	and to allow gamete preservation and manipulation. Oocyte maturation
	and ovulation or spermiation can be induced in many species by a
	large variety of hormones (GnRHs, fish gonadotropins, hCG, various
	steroids etc). Some information is available on gamete biology and
	preservation. Sperm motility is short-lived, not exceeding 70-80
	s of forward movement as in most other freshwater teleosts. A peculiarity
	of the European catfish sperm is the activation by urine during sampling
	which could be prevented by direct collection in an immobilizing
	solution (NaCl 200 mM, Tris HCl 30 mM, pH 7.0). Spermatozoa cryopreservation
	was successfully attempted in several species. Ova generally survive
	only a few hours after ovulation and fertilization must be carried
	out soon after. Methods for gamete collection, insemination and incubation
	of eggs are described for the most widely cultured siluroid species.},

	The samples were used to obtain data on the reproductive biology
	of this species in three very different environments. Unlike females,
	the males show a loosening of the attachment of the abdominal flap
	to the cephalothorax at a prepubertal rather than a pubertal molt.
	Males become gonadally mature (spermatophores and seminal fluid present
	in the medial region of the vas deferentia) at a very similar carapace
	width (CW) to that at which they achieve morphometric maturity, as
	reflected by a change in the relative size of the largest cheliped.
	Logistic curves, derived from the prevalence of mature male P. pelagicus,
	generally had wider confidence limits with morphometric than with
	gonadal data. This presumably reflects the fact that the morphometric
	(allometric) method of classifying a male R pelagicus as mature employs
	probabilities and is thus indirect, whereas gonadal structure allows
	a mature male to be readily identified. However, the very close correspondence
	between the CW50's derived for P. pelagicus by the two methods implies

	pelagicus attained maturity at a significantly greater size in the

	previously explained by a trade-off between gamete quality and quantity:
	the production of many small eggs with high mortality or fewer large
	eggs that develop quickly and experience reduced planktonic mortality.
	This theory assumes 100% fertilization of eggs and predicts that
	either strategy results in a similar number of settling offspring
	per unit of energy invested in reproduction. Empirical support for
	the theory has been equivocal. Here I offer an alternative hypothesis:
	larger eggs present a larger target for sperm and thus are fertilized
	at a higher rate. This theory suggests a trade-off between the production
	of many small eggs with a low probability of fertilization or fewer
	large eggs with a higher probability of fertilization. This hypothesis
	is tested with three congeneric sea urchins, Strongylocentrolus purpuratus,
	Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, and Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis,
	with a fivefold difference in egg volume. Species with larger eggs
	are fertilized at a higher rate and, if one assumes an equal allocation
	of resources, produce at least as many zygotes as species with smaller,
	more numerous eggs. This alternate hypothesis can explain continuous
	variation in egg size between species and provides a strong link
	between larval and adult life histories.},

	comparisons of polyandrous and non-polyandrous taxa showed that females

	this result by indicating a significant decrease in egg size after

	females have evolved smaller egg sizes in response to selection to
	match smaller size of males, which provide the parental care in these
	species. Second, reduction in egg size was not related to longer

	at different temperatures (18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 32 degrees
	C). The periods of gonad development also differed significantly
	at different temperatures (F-7,F-32 = 154.065, P < 0.01). The optimal
	temperature was 28 degrees C based on the shortest developmental
	duration to stage V (mean standard deviation) (85.2 +/- 6.3 7 days).
	The GSI peaked at 28 degrees C (16.60 +/- 0.43%) and it displayed
	significantly higher than those of other seven trials (P < 0.01).
	The relationship between the GSI and the temperatures can be expressed

	The range from 26 to 28 degrees C was suggested as the optimal temperature
	for fecundity and spawning of H. kuda because of the large number
	of eggs in the ovaries. The relationship between fecundity number

	F-5,F- 24= 101.897, P < 0.01). Compared with control seahorses, the
	results indicated that the condition indices such as the GSI, fecundity,
	spawning, fertilization, and hatching during the early development
	could affect in part the survival rate of the newborn juveniles (which
	was also an indirect effect of temperature). However, there were
	no marked differences at temperatures from 24 to 28 degrees C with
	the similar high survival rate. Based on this, the temperature range
	from 26 to 28 degrees C was recommended for gonad development and

	in the Georges Bank fish community. There has been a noticeable shift
	in the abundance of these predators during the last four decades
	which is generally attributed to fishing pressure. Although many
	fish persist as piscivores in this system, not only has their relative
	abundance changed but their size composition has also changed. Both
	factors influence the total magnitude of piscivory by these fish.
	To ascertain the cascading effects of fishing on fish predation,
	we examined relative abundance, total stomach contents, diet composition,
	consumption rates, and total food consumption of fish for several
	species across the time period. The proportion of the diet comprised
	by fish for piscivores on Georges Bank has remained remarkably consistent.
	However, the composition of specific fish prey has changed across
	the time series, Total fish consumption generally tracked predator
	abundance, but two species demonstrated compensating consumption
	rates as larger size classes declined. Contrary to our initial hypothesis,
	total fish consumption by six major predators has remained generally
	constant despite changes in predator size, structure and abundance.
	One reason for constant systemic piscivory is the dominant piscivore
	in this ecosystem has shifted from cod to spiny dogfish. We assert
	that a major effect of intense fishing pressure is a shift in energy

	Measures of condition (weight at length, liver size and lipid content
	in muscle and liver), feeding potential (digestive tract weight)
	and reproductive potential (gonad weight) were compared between substrate
	type, bathymetric zone, level of protection, sexes and maturity stages.
	The study reveals differences in the condition of white seabream
	between adjacent habitats. During the juvenile phase, fish condition
	was generally higher in the unprotected rocky coast than in the unprotected
	sandy coast. In addition, post-spawners were better conditioned within
	the rocky areas of the reserve than in adjacent unprotected rocky
	areas. At the Banyuls-Cerb6re Marine Reserve, the reproductive potential
	of male spawners decreased with depth, but the condition of spawners
	followed the opposite trend. However, we did not find any significant
	effect of protection on feeding or reproductive potential. With the

	which offspring success increases rapidly. The model can explain
	various observed differences in amounts of parental care, such as
	those of r-selected versus K-selected species. The work of an unrecognized
	predecessor of r- and K-selection theory, E. J. Salisbury, is acknowledged.

	western France. I assessed reproductive success using ratios among
	the number of clutches, the number of froglets, and the daily number
	of adult frogs. I also determined the survival rate of offspring.
	Conclusions: Males dominated in 90%, of ponds; the mean adult sex
	ratio and operational sex ratio ranged from 0.84 to 3.14 and from
	2.84 to 13.71 respectively. The number of post-metamorphic froglets
	per clutch averaged 9.37 (S.D. = 2.37). Variations in the adult sex
	ratio and operational sex ratio did affect reproductive success.
	Froglet survival was diminished in populations with higher proportions
	of males. Furthermore, although each female produced a single clutch
	regardless of sex ratio, higher proportions of males depressed the
	average number of clutches per male. Evidently, adult male competition
	and sexual conflict reduce the fitness of both males and females.},

	comprises high-bodied, slow speed carnivores with molariform teeth

	high-bodied but with conical teeth feeding mostly on small or soft-shelled
	benthic prey. Inferring the evolution of these trophic types within
	Lethrinus using morphology is problematic since these characters
	are typically correlated with feeding mode and are potentially homoplasious.
	We use mitochondrial DNA sequences, to independently determine a
	phylogenetic hypothesis for Lethrinus, which are not dependent on
	morphological characters relating to trophic categories. We analyzed
	complete cytochrome b gene sequences (1140 bp) for 20 species of
	Lethrinus, representing the three trophic types. and for 13 outgroup
	species, including four other representatives of the Lethrinidae.
	A monophyletic Lethrinidae did not resolve, but the monophyly of
	Lethrinus is well supported. In addition, two major clades within
	Lethrinus are well supported. One of these clades exclusively contains
	low-bodied species with conical teeth while the other clade only
	comprises the high-bodied species with molariform teeth. A high-bodied
	species with conical teeth, Lethrinus miniatus, appears most ancestral
	and sister to all other Lethrinus species. We hypothesize that this
	generalist trophic type was the evolutionary precursor to both of

  abstract = {Species richness is an important characteristic of ecological communities,
	but it is difficult to quantify. We report here a thorough inventory
	of a tropical rain forest ant fauna and use it to evaluate species
	richness estimators. The study was carried out in ~ 1500 ha of lowland
	rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Diverse methods
	were used, including canopy fogging, Malaise traps, Berlese samples,
	Winkler samples, baiting, and manual search. Workers of 437 ant species
	were encountered. The abundance distribution was clearly lognormal,
	and the distribution emerged from a veil line with each doubling
	of sampling effort. Three richness estimates were calculated: the
	area under the fitted lognormal distribution, the asymptote of the
	Michaelis-Menten equation fit to the species accumulation curve,
	and the Incidence-based Coverage Estimator (ICE). The performance
	of the estimators was evaluated with sample-based rarefaction plots.
	The inventory was nearly complete because the species accumulation
	curve approached an asymptote, the richness estimates were very close
	to the observed species richness, and the uniques and duplicates
	curves were both declining. None of the richness estimators was stable
	in sample-based rarefaction plots, but regions of stability of estimators
	occurred. The explanation of rarity is one key to understanding why
	richness estimates fail. Fifty-one species (12% of the total) were
	still uniques (known from only one sample) at the end of the inventory.
	The rarity of 20 of these species was explained by "edge effects":
	"methodological edge species" (possibly abundant at the site but
	difficult to sample because of their microhabitat), and "geographic
	edge species," known to be common in habitats or regions outside
	of La Selva. Rarity of 31 species remained unexplained. Most of the
	51 rare species were known from additional collections outside of
	La Selva, either in other parts of Costa Rica or in other countries.
	Only six species were "global uniques," known to date from only one
	sample on Earth. The study demonstrates that patterns of species
	occurrence early in an inventory may be inadequate to estimate species
	richness, but that relatively complete inventories of species-rich
	arthropod communities are possible if multiple sampling methods and
	extensive effort are applied.},

	Selva project (ALAS), a structured inventory of the ants of a lowland
	tropical rain forest was carried out. A novel method of sample processing
	was developed, in which parataxonomists prepared specimens based
	on their own sorting of morphospecies within samples (repeating the
	process for each sample, and thus not attempting to crossreference
	morphospecies among samples), and a taxonomic specialist later sorted
	the resultant pool of prepared specimens. Efficacy of stratifying
	by sampling method (Berlese samples, Malaise traps, and canopy fogging),
	habitat, and time was investigated. Novel methods of analysis were
	used, including (1) curves depicting cost in prepared specimens of
	adding species to the inventory, as a function of number of species
	already captured, (2) within-vs. among-treatment species accumulation
	curves, and (3) matched rank-abundance plots. Over 400 species of
	ants are known from the site, of which the structured inventory captured
	253. Projection of the species accumulation curve revealed that continuation
	of the same methods would not be an efficient method of capturing
	additional species, and that additional methods would be needed.
	Considered separately, Berlese, Malaise, and fogging samples were
	similarly efficient. Berlese samples combined with either Malaise
	or fogging samples were far more efficient than single methods because
	the faunas they sampled were highly complementary. Combining Malaise
	and fogging samples did not increase efficiency because the faunas
	they sampled had low complementarity At the scale of our sampling,
	there was little evidence that spatial, temporal, or habitat stratification
	increased efficiency of inventory for Berlese and Malaise samples.
	For canopy fogging, processing a portion of the catch from multiple
	trees was more efficient than processing the entire catch from one

  abstract = {Reproductive timing can be defined as the temporal pattern of reproduction
	over a lifetime. Although reproductive timing is highly variable
	in marine fishes, certain traits are universal, including sexual
	maturity, undergoing one or more reproductive cycles, participating
	in one or more spawning events within a reproductive cycle, release
	of eggs or offspring, aging, and death. These traits commonly occur
	at four temporal scales: lifetime, annual, intraseasonal, and diel.
	It has long been known that reproductive timing affects reproductive
	success, especially in terms of the onset of sexual maturity and
	the match or mismatch between seasonal spawning and offspring survival.
	However, a comprehensive understanding of variability in reproductive
	timing over species, populations, and temporal scales is lacking.
	In addition, there is a need to assess how variability in reproductive
	timing affects a population's resilience. Because natural selection
	occurs at the individual level, this necessitates an understanding
	of within-population (i.e., individual) variability in reproductive
	timing and how fishing may impact it through age truncation and size-specific
	selectivity or fisheries-induced evolution. In this paper, we review
	the temporal aspects of reproductive strategies and the four most-studied
	reproductive timing characteristics in fishes: sexual maturity, spawning
	seasonality, spawning frequency, and diel periodicity. For each characteristic,
	we synthesize how it has traditionally been measured, advances in
	understanding the underlying physiology, its role in equilibrium-based
	fish population dynamics, and its importance to reproductive success.
	We then provide a review of emerging methodology with an emphasis
	on ovarian histology to improve our ability to assess variability
	in reproductive timing both among populations and within populations.},

	is first expressed. Rainbow trout and channel catfish show the first

	ontogeny of complement component C3 has been studied in Atlantic
	halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua
	L.) and the spotted wolffish (Anarhichas minor O.). By Western blotting
	experiments C3 was found in unfertilised eggs in the spotted wolffish
	indicating a maternal transfer. RTPCR analysis revealed C3 mRNA transcripts
	from 290 d degrees in spotted wolffish eggs. Using immunohistochemistry
	and in situ hybridisation, C3 was found in liver, brain, kidney and
	muscle of cod larvae 2 days post-hatching and in intestines, pancreas,
	heart and gills at different stages of larval development. Also,
	C3 was detectable in halibut larvae in yolk sac, muscle, liver, brain,
	chondrocytes, spinal chord, eye, heart, intestines and kidney. These

	different organs, not only in the defence against invading pathogens.
	Lysozyme is a bactericidal enzyme present in mucus, lymphoid tissue

	carbonates from the Monograptus lochkoviensis Zone to the end of
	the Monograptus transgrediens Zone reflects an increase of bioproductivity
	in the marine ecosystem. This increase was probably caused by a shallowing
	of the upwelling system, thus importing nutrient-rich water. A progressive
	cooling during the Pridoli and earliest Lochkovian triggered these
	changes in the upwelling system. Our data also show an increase in
	total diversity of cephalopod species, which may be explained by
	greater availability of new food sources for a period corresponding
	to the progressive increase in delta(13)C values. In the latest Silurian,
	delta(13)C reached its maximal values while the Lochkovian is characterized
	by steady conditions with a decreasing tendency in delta(13)C values.
	Strong, selective extinction started in the latest Silurian Monograptus

	species with relatively large eggs and long incubation times. The

  abstract = {The relationship between the biomass of reproductively mature individuals
	(spawning stock) and the resulting offspring added to the population
	(recruitment), the stock–recruitment relationship, is a fundamental
	and challenging problem in all of population biology. The steepness
	of this relationship is commonly defined as the fraction of recruitment
	from an unfished population obtained when the spawning stock biomass
	is 20% of its unfished level. Since its introduction about 20 years
	ago, steepness has become widely used in fishery management, where
	it is usually treated as a statistical quantity. Here, we investigate
	the reproductive ecology of steepness, using both unstructured and
	age-structured models. We show that if one has sufficient information
	to construct a density-independent population model (maximum per
	capita productivity and natural mortality for the unstructured case
	or maximum per capita productivity, natural mortality and schedules
	of size and maturity at age for the structured model) then one can
	construct a point estimate for steepness. Thus, steepness cannot
	be chosen arbitrarily. If one assumes that the survival of recruited
	individuals fluctuates within populations, it is possible, by considering
	the early life history, to construct a prior distribution for steepness
	from this same demographic information. We develop the ideas for
	both compensatory (Beverton–Holt) and over-compensatory (Ricker)
	stock–recruitment relationships. We illustrate our ideas with an
	example concerning bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus/orientalis, Scombridae).
	We show that assuming that steepness is unity when recruitment is
	considered to be environmentally driven is not biologically consistent,
	is inconsistent with a precautionary approach, and leads to the wrong
	scientific inference (which also applies for assigning steepness
	any other single value).},

	evolution, consistent with a previous notion that convergent selection
	in fishes can readily mold the underlying suites of reproductive
	hormones into similar behaviors. The evolutionary appearance of MARTs
	was significantly correlated with the presence of sexually selected
	traits in bourgeois males (P = 0.001) but not with the presence of
	male parental care. This suggests that MARTs often arise from selection
	on some males to circumvent bourgeois male investment in mate monopolization,
	rather than to avoid male brood care per se. We found parsimony evidence
	for an evolutionary progression of MARTs wherein sneaking is usually
	the evolutionary precursor to the presumably more complex MARTs of
	female mimicry and cooperative satellite behavior. Nest piracy appears
	not to be part of this evolutionary progression, possibly because
	its late onset in the life cycle of most ray-finned fishes reduces
	the effects of selection on this reproductive tactic.},

	differences were greatest between south-west Scotian Shelf cod and

	Significant differences were also observed between two putative populations
	on the south-west Scotian Shelf, suggesting genetic divergence between
	spawning aggregations at small spatial scales (< 100 km). Temperature
	and food supply also influenced body shape, with the effect of the

	or food level had a deeper body and a larger head than those reared
	at the lower temperature or food supply. Phenotypic responses to
	changes in the rearing environment also differed among populations,

	determining the feasibility of using Udonella sp., a common flatworm
	found on copepod ectoparasites of the Chilean rock cod, Eleginops

	were studied: distribution and preference of Udonella sp. regarding
	both host sex and body location on copepods collected from both the
	Chilean rock cod and cultured salmonids; the effect of Udonella on
	both fecundity and survival of the free-living stages; and seasonal
	variations of population of both Udonella and the copepod. Results
	indicated that Udonella sp. is frequently found on copepods collected
	from the Chilean rock cod, but is absent on those from cultured salmonids.
	The flatworm showed a marked preference for female copepods and the
	main body locations used by Udonella are the genital complex and
	egg sacs. The three life stages of Udonella are distributed across
	the copepod body in different ways since different body locations
	represent feeding and nursery areas. Udonella has no significant
	effect either on fecundity or survival of free-living stages. Udonella
	may maintain its population relatively independent of the Caligus
	infra-population all year round. Seasonal patterns of variation were
	not evident for the population parameters of either Caligus or Udonella,
	probably due to the exceptional environmental conditions that occurred
	during 1997 that allowed Caligus populations to remain high during
	fall and winter, instead of decreasing as it has been reported previously.
	Results suggest that Udonella cannot be used as a biological control
	for sea lice since it is not found naturally on salmonid species

	The relationship assumes that spawner biomass (in tonnes) is proportional
	to the total number of eggs produced (TEP) by the stock(3), an assumption
	under increasing challenge(4-8). Most stocks require proxies for
	TEP because contemporary and/or historical fecundity data are lacking.
	Here we show a positive association between recruitment and the liver
	weights of spawners in the Barents Sea cod stock which suggests that
	recruitment is constrained by the amount of lipid energy stored in
	the liver. This stimulated our interest in estimating total lipid
	energy (TLE; in kilojoules) for mature females in the stock. We examined
	the suitability of TLE as a proxy through correlation and simulation
	analyses. The results indicate that TLE is proportional to TEP and
	exhibits a similar response to varying food abundance. Replacing
	spawner biomass with more accurate measures of reproductive potential
	is essential to developing a rational basis for stock conservation(9).
	Correctly specifying the first-order maternal effect on TEP is a

	Information on abundance, age, and size distributions during peak
	spawning, potential fecundity, egg size, and estimated larval viabilities
	were used to contrast the reproductive potential of three adjacent
	spawning areas within the main spawning ground of cod in the Icelandic
	waters. The three areas differed with respect to age and size distribution,
	abundance, mean production per female and an index of total egg production.
	Larger and faster growing cod spawned closer to the coast (area 1).
	Smaller cod spawned in deeper water out on Selvogsbanki (area 2),
	and the smallest and youngest cad tended to spawn along the continental
	edge (area 3). Relative abundance was higher in area 2 than in areas
	1 and 3 (640, 153, and 334 kg/net, respectively). Mean production
	of eggs per female was highest in area 1, while the index of total
	egg production was highest in area 2. The estimates of viable egg

	of viable eggs produced were slightly higher in area 1 than in areas

	It is shown that this spatial variation in size is not explained

	spawning periods of surviving 0-group cod captured along the north
	and the east coast and the recorded spawning time for cod on the

	gathered in the plankton. Morphological plasticity of feeding structures
	has been demonstrated in multiple phyla, in which food-limited larvae
	increase feeding structure size to increase feeding rates. However,
	before larvae can feed exogenously they depend largely on material
	contained within the egg to build larval structures and to fuel larval
	metabolism. Thus, the capacity for plasticity of feeding structures
	early in development may depend on egg size. Using the congeneric
	sea urchins Strongylocentrotus franciscanus and S. purpuratus, which
	differ in egg volume by 5-fold, I tested whether the degree of expression
	of feeding structure (larval ann length) plasticity is correlated
	with differences in the size of the egg. I experimentally manipulated
	egg size of S. franciscanus (the larger-egged species) by separating
	blastomeres at the 2-cell stage to produce half-sized larvae. I reared
	half-size and normal-size larvae under high and low food treatments
	for 20 days. I measured arm and body lengths at multiple ages during
	development and calculated the degree of plasticity expressed by
	larvae from all treatments. Control and unmanipulated S. franciscanus
	larvae (from similar to 1.0 nl eggs) had significantly longer arms
	relative to body size and a significantly greater degree of plasticity
	than half-sized S. franciscanus larvae (from < 0.18 nl eggs), which
	in turn expressed a significantly greater degree of plasticity than
	S. purpuratus larvae (from similar to 0.3 nl eggs). These results
	indicate that egg size affects larval arm length plasticity in the
	genus Strongylocentrotus; larger eggs produce more-plastic larvae
	both in an experimental and a comparative context. However, changes
	in egg size alone are not sufficient to account for evolved differences
	in the pattern of plasticity expressed by each species over time
	and may not be sufficient for the evolutionary transition from feeding
	to non-feeding. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	dusk. We collected D. punctatus in the eastern Gulf of Mexico during
	three April cruises (1995, 1996, and 1997). Based on histological
	criteria, size at 50% maturity was 113 mm fork length (FL) for males
	and 128 turn FL for females. The gonad-somatic index (GSI) of mature
	males was significantly different between hours and appeared to show
	diel periodicity. Diel periodicity was also observed in changes in
	female GSIs, whole oocyte diameters, and ovarian histology. The average
	GSI of mature females fluctuated two-fold between day and night,

	from counts of whole oocytes in final maturation. Hemiramphus brasiliensis
	lived longer (4 versus 2 years) and had a higher survival rate (14.9%
	versus 7.5% annually) than H. balao did. Of the two species the larger
	and longer-lived congener, H. brasiliensis, reached sexual maturity
	at a larger size (fork length 198 versus 160 mm). The spawning period
	of age-0 females was strongly related to season, whereas spawning
	by older females occurred throughout the year. Reproduction by both
	species peaked during late spring or early summer, and all mature
	females were spawning daily during April (H. brasiliensis) or June
	(H. balao). This is the first demonstration of iteroparity for the
	family Hemiramphidae. H. brasiliensis had a lower batch fecundity
	(about 1164 versus 3743 hydrated oocytes for a 100-g female) than
	H. balao did. Such low batch fecundities are typical of the order
	Beloniformes, but quite different from those of other fishes that
	live in association with coral reef habitats. H. balao's higher batch
	fecundity is consistent with the life-history theory that predicts
	higher numbers of eggs for shorter-lived species; this is possible
	because H. balao produces smaller hydrated oocytes than H. brasiliensis
	(modal diameter about 1.6 versus 2.4 mm). The high spawning frequency
	of Hemiramphus species compensates for their low batch fecundity.
	The annual fecundity of both species is similar to that of other
	reef fish species, after adjusting for body size and spawning frequency.
	The lifetime fecundity of H. balao was very similar to that of H.
	brasiliensis, after accounting for the differences in survival for

  abstract = {Female winter flounder were examined using gonad histology to determine
	the adequacy of routine macroscopic maturity classification methods
	and to determine the spatial variation in size and age of maturity
	in US. waters. Sampling occurred in spring and autumn, which was
	adequate to collect immature, mature, spawning-active, and non-active
	females. Females were collected in coastal waters from Delaware Bay,
	USA, to the Scotian Shelf, Canada, including in Long Island Sound
	and on Georges Bank, which covered all U.S. stock areas. Mature fish
	spawned in spring, when gonads comprised up to 30% of the total body
	weight. Direct comparisons of maturity assignment by macroscopic
	versus microscopic methods demonstrated that both schemes are compatible,
	but the more cost-effective macroscopic method had trouble distinguishing
	larger immature from smaller resting females. Spatial comparisons,
	using gonad histology only, supported the existence of three stocks
	in U.S. waters, but also revealed significant variation in age at
	maturity within the two coastal stocks. Age-at-maturity was more
	variable than size-at-maturity, which is consistent with known stock-specific
	patterns of growth rates and a postulated life history tradeoff to
	delay maturity until a size threshold is reached. The within-stock
	variation in median age at maturity, about one year for coastal stocks,
	recommends further investigation of using static, stock-specific
	maturity ogives to calculate reference points for management. Published

  abstract = {Aim Phylogeographical breaks' often occur at biogeographical province
	boundaries, suggesting common causative factors. Cape Hatteras, North
	Carolina, on the US Atlantic coast, separates water masses of sharply
	differing temperature and divides the Virginian and Carolinian provinces,
	but has not often been detected as a phylogeographical break. We
	studied the black sea bass, Centropristis striata (Linnaeus, 1758),
	a species with philopatric adults but long-lived planktonic larvae.
	An earlier study of only two Atlantic populations, and lower-resolution
	mitochondrial RFLP markers, showed strong separation between the
	Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, but not across Cape Hatteras. Location
	Over 300 adults were collected from populations from the Gulf of
	Mexico, the US south Atlantic (North Carolina south of Cape Hatteras,
	the east coast of Florida, and South Carolina), and the US mid-Atlantic
	(North Carolina north of Cape Hatteras, Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey
	and Massachusetts). Methods We sequenced the mitochondrial control
	region, analysed DNA sequence and haplotype frequency differentiation
	and haplotype networks, and performed coalescent analyses of population
	sizes and migration rates. Results Sequences formed three clusters
	- Gulf of Mexico, south Atlantic and mid-Atlantic - the Atlantic
	clusters being divided at Cape Hatteras. Analyses of molecular variance
	(AMOVA) showed that 31% of sequence variation was between populations
	on opposite sides of Cape Hatteras, while only 5% was between populations
	on the same side, yet migrate analysis detected asymmetric migration
	across the Cape, greater from north to south than in the opposite
	direction. A transitional population with roughly equal frequencies
	of south and mid-Atlantic haplotypes occupied a narrow stretch between
	Cape Hatteras and the Virginia border. Main conclusions Strong barriers
	to gene flow exist between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, and
	across Cape Hatteras. Adult migratory and spawning behaviours that
	separate mid-Atlantic and south Atlantic populations, limited larval
	exchange, and selection imposed by thermal gradients are each potentially
	responsible. In addition, these data indicate that fishery stocks
	of black sea bass north and south of Cape Hatteras are genetically
	distinct, supporting their separate management.},

	not commercially important, the sheepshead is a significant recreational
	species, and most of the fishing pressure occurs in state waters.
	From 1990 to 2005, 5,692 sheepsheads were collected from fishery-dependent
	and fishery-independent monitoring programs in South Carolina. Fish
	ranged from 102 to 605 mm in fork length (FL) and were caught during

	ages 2-5. Marginal increment analysis confirmed the formation of
	a single annulus per year, and annulus formation began in May. Males
	and females did not significantly differ in FL at age t(FL(t)) or
	total weight at age t (W(t)); the pooled von Bertalanffy growth models

	Although size was a better predictor of fecundity than age, the relationship
	was weak due to the high variability in size at age. Comparisons

	since the macroscopic scale was produced in 1961. The aim of this
	study was to assess the accuracy of macroscopic maturity staging
	of female North Sea herring by comparison to histological staging
	and the gonadosomatic index (GSI). Ovary samples were collected during
	the North Sea Herring Acoustic Survey in 2006 on-board FRV 'Scotia'
	(Scotland) and in 2007 on-board FRV 'Scotia' and RV 'Johan Hjort'
	(Norway). Commercial samples were also collected by Marine Scotland,
	Aberdeen in both years. The maturity staging error was relatively
	low in 2006 (21% error) but was much higher on-board FRV 'Scotia'
	(57%) and RV 'Johan Hjort' (47%) in 2007. There was estimated to
	be a 27% under-estimation of the spawning stock biomass (SSB) in
	2007 due to the differences in the proportion mature but no change
	in SSB estimates in 2006. GSI cut-off scores, estimated by means
	of multinomial regression models were successfully able to separate
	immature females from both mature-active and recovering females;
	however, there was some overlap between the mature-active and recovering
	individuals. We conclude that an effective and low-cost means of
	reducing error in herring maturity studies is the combined use of
	a four-point macroscopic maturity scale with routinely collected
	GSI data, the latter acting to validate and fine tune macroscopic

	on production of viable eggs independent of season. This can only
	be done by manipulation of maturation by photoperiod, but little
	is known about potential effects on egg characteristics and larval
	viability. In two cod broodstocks, maturation was successfully advanced
	or delayed 6 months compared with normal spawning season (Marchâ€“April)
	by manipulation of photoperiod. The advanced broodstock spawned both
	in spring and autumn the same year. In two of the spawning tanks
	during autumn, ambient temperature was reduced after reaching 13.7Â°C
	during the first half of the spawning period. Egg quality and viability
	were monitored, and several egg batches were incubated, hatched and
	start-fed for examination of growth and survival. Temperatures above
	9.6Â°C resulted in significant reductions in fertilization and
	normal egg development. Concurrently, fractions of dead and unfertilized
	eggs increased with elevated temperature. Actual relative fecundity
	was not affected by temperature. Egg characteristics improved when
	temperature was controlled and lowered below 9.6Â°C. Occurrence
	of irregular spawners suggests that handling of broodstock fish should
	be avoided during maturation and spawning. Cod larvae originating
	from eggs of the advanced or delayed broodstocks were successfully
	reared beyond metamorphosis. Survival was 9.0â€“46.6% and 29.3%
	in green and clear water respectively. Survival correlated with both
	initial and average feeding conditions, but growth rate did not correlate
	with either of survival and feeding conditions. Specific growth rates
	(8.3â€“13.6% day<sup>âˆ’1</sup>) is comparable with other

	spawning biomass, it is critical to have accurate maturity schedules.
	We investigated size- and age-dependent patterns in maturity for
	southern flounder Paralichthys lethostigma, a flatfish supporting
	valuable coastal fisheries in North Carolina and throughout its range.
	We evaluated both macroscopic and histological methods over two consecutive
	reproductive seasons. Histological analyses revealed that maturity
	occurred at larger sizes and older ages than previously estimated.
	Length at 50% maturity (L-50) was estimated at 408 mm total length
	(TL), which was more than 60 mm larger than currently assumed, and
	was relatively stable between study years. We found that only 44%
	of age-1 southern flounder were mature compared with an estimated
	74% in an earlier study. We suspect that most of the differences
	in maturity timing of southern flounder between our findings and
	previous studies stem from macroscopic assignment error. During this
	study, only 61% of fish staged macroscopically as developing were
	found to be mature based on histological analysis. Assuming incorrectly
	that all of these fish were mature would have resulted in an L-50
	of 375 mm TL, which is closer to previous estimates. Analysis of
	spawning stock biomass per recruit demonstrated that biological reference
	points (e.g., F-SPR) could be affected considerably by shifting maturity
	schedules, and the effects could be magnified at larger sizes at
	entry and higher harvest rates. Given the life history strategy of
	southern flounder and the lack of a developed offshore fishery or
	sampling program, which combine to prevent access to fish on the
	spawning grounds, it is probably most judicious to routinely analyze
	reproductive tissue samples histologically to ensure accurate information
	on the timing of maturity.},

	and starvation, to activity and searching ability, and to risk of
	predation. Regressions based on data from 72 species of marine and
	freshwater species suggest that body size is an important factor
	that unifies many of the published observations. A conceptual framework

  journal = {Conservation Biology},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {21},
  pages = {36-47},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Abstract:Selective harvesting regimes are often implemented because
	age and sex classes contribute differently to population dynamics
	and hunters show preferences associated with body size and trophy
	value. We reviewed the literature on how such cropping regimes affect
	the demography of the remaining population (here termed demographic
	side effects ). First, we examined the implications of removing a
	large proportion of a specific age or sex class. Such harvesting
	strategies often bias the population sex ratio toward females and
	reduce the mean age of males, which may consequently delay birth
	dates, reduce birth synchrony, delay body mass development, and alter
	offspring sex ratios. Second, we reviewed the side effects associated
	with the selective removal of relatively few specific individuals,
	often large trophy males. Such selective harvesting can destabilize
	social structures and the dominance hierarchy and may cause loss
	of social knowledge, sexually selected infanticide, habitat changes
	among reproductive females, and changes in offspring sex ratio. A
	common feature of many of the reported mechanisms is that they ultimately
	depress recruitment and in some extreme cases even cause total reproductive
	collapse. These effects could act additively and destabilize the
	dynamics of populations, thus having a stronger effect on population
	growth rate than first anticipated. Although more experimental than
	observational studies reported demographic side effects, we argue
	that this may reflect the quite subtle mechanisms involved, which
	are unlikely to be detected in observational studies without rigorous
	monitoring regimes. We call for more detailed studies of hunted populations
	with marked individuals that address how the expression of these
	effects varies across mating systems, habitats, and with population
	density. Theoretical models investigating how strongly these effects
	influence population growth rates are also required. Resumen:Los
	regimenes de cosecha selectiva a menudo son implementados porque
	las clases de edad y sexo contribuyen distintamente a la dinámica
	de la población y los cazadores muestran preferencias asociadas
	con el tamaño corporal y el valor como trofeo. Revisamos la literatura
	sobre los efectos de esos regimenes de cosecha sobre la demografía
	del resto de la población (denominados aquí efectos demográficos
	secundarios). Primero, examinamos las implicaciones de la remoción
	de la mayor parte de una clase específica de edad o sexo. Tales
	estrategias de cosecha a menudo sesgan la proporción de sexos de
	la población hacia hembras y reducen la edad promedio de los machos,
	lo que consecuentemente puede retardar fechas de nacimiento, reducir
	la sincronía de nacimientos, retardar el desarrollo de la masa corporal
	y alterar la proporción de sexos de las crías. Segundo, revisamos
	los efectos secundarios asociados con la remoción selectiva de relativamente
	pocos individuos específicos, a menudo machos grandes. Tal cosecha
	selectiva puede desestabilizar las estructuras sociales y la jerarquía
	de dominancia y puede provocar la pérdida de conocimiento social,
	infanticidio seleccionado sexualmente, cambios de hábitat entre
	hembras reproductivas y cambios en la proporción de sexos de las
	crías. Una característica común de muchos de los mecanismos reportados
	es que, a fin de cuentas, deprimen el reclutamiento y en algunos
	casos extremos causan un colapso reproductivo total. Estos efectos
	pueden actuar aditivamente y desestabilizar la dinámica de las poblaciones,
	por lo que tienen un mayor efecto que el esperado sobre la tasa de
	crecimiento poblacional. Aunque estudios más experimentales que
	de observación reportaron efectos demográficos secundarios, argumentamos
	que esto puede reflejar los sutiles mecanismos implicados, que pueden
	no ser detectados en estudios de observación sin regimenes de monitoreo
	rigurosos. Hacemos un llamado para la realización de estudios más
	detallados de poblaciones cazadas utilizando individuos marcados
	para abordar la variación de esos efectos en sistemas de apareamiento,
	hábitats y densidades poblacionales diferentes. También se requieren
	modelos teóricos que investiguen el impacto de estos efectos sobre
	las tasas de crecimiento poblacional.},

	of assuming a static productivity regime. Here we develop and evaluate
	a multivariate stock–recruitment state-space model to simultaneously
	estimate time-varying stock productivity and synchronicity of dynamics
	across populations. We apply the method to North Atlantic cod (Gadus

	stages has varied markedly over time, with many populations at historically
	low productivity. Trends in productivity were similar in some adjacent
	populations but less regionally coherent than previously thought,
	particularly in the Northwest Atlantic. Latitudinal variation in
	the Northeast Atlantic suggests a differential response to environmental
	change. We conclude that time-varying productivity provides a useful

  abstract = {Marine organisms exhibit a wide range of egg sizes, even among closely
	related taxa, and egg size is widely considered to be one of the
	most important components of the life histories of marine species.
	The nature of the trade-off between egg size and number and the consequences
	of variation in egg size for offspring growth and survivorship have
	been extensively modeled. Yet, there is little empirical evidence
	that supports the relative importance of particular environmental
	parameters in engendering the tremendous variation in egg size seen
	in marine organisms. This study compares egg sizes between six geminate
	species pairs of bivalves in the family Arcidae to determine whether
	egg size differs in predictable directions between geminate species
	in the two oceans separated by the Central American isthmus, and
	whether the direction and timing of egg size evolution among geminates
	in this family is correlated with both modern and paleoceanographic
	patterns of oceanic productivity. In all modern members of six geminate
	pairs, egg size was larger in the species in the western Atlantic
	than in its sister species the eastern Pacific. This pattern supports
	the hypothesis that optimal egg size differs in the two oceans due
	to the low productivity and poor larval feeding environment in the
	western Atlantic relative to the eastern Pacific. The fossil record
	of one geminate pair shows that egg size has remained consistently
	large in the western Atlantic from the Miocene to the Recent, while
	egg size in the eastern Pacific has decreased to the current small
	size in less than 2 million years; this suggests that modern-day
	differences between egg sizes in the western Atlantic and eastern
	Pacific are due to either an increase in productivity in the eastern
	Pacific and subsequent selection for smaller eggs in that ocean,
	or differential patterns of extinction that occurred well after the
	rise of the isthmus. These results agree with ancestral character
	state reconstruction using linear parsimony, but differ from squared-change
	parsimony reconstructions.},

	marine biota of Neogene tropical America, including widespread extinctions
	of marine taxa in the Western Atlantic (WA) and life history shifts
	among marine species with free-living larvae. In both echinoderms
	and bivalves, egg sizes are larger in the WA than in the eastern
	Pacific (EP) when comparisons are made between species pairs in which
	one inhabits the WA and its closest relative is found in the Eastern
	Pacific (EP) (= ‘geminate’ species). Because the WA is much less
	productive than the EP, large eggs in the WA may represent an adaptation
	to offset the poorer larval feeding environment in that ocean. Here
	I use both phylogenetic data and the fossil record to test the hypothesis
	that present-day egg size patterns in bivalve geminates evolved in
	response to the well-documented drop in productivity that occurred
	in the WA around the time of Isthmus closure. Phylogenetic ancestral
	character state reconstruction using 17 arcid species indicated that
	for all geminate pairs, each living Pacific species has smaller eggs
	than the pair’s common ancestor. Data from the fossil record also
	support the EP as the site of the most egg size evolution; in one
	geminate lineage, egg size has been large in the WA from the Miocene
	to the present, indicating that evolutionary change likely occurred
	as egg size reductions in the EP. These data suggest that if egg
	size of planktotrophic species does indeed evolve in response to
	changing oceanic productivity, downward shifts in egg size in response
	to increased productivity are as or more likely to occur than increases
	in egg size in response to lowered productivity.},

  abstract = {The functional anatomy of the male reproductive system was studied
	by histology and scanning electron microscopy on Jonah crabs, Cancer
	borealis Stimpson, 1859, collected from the Scotian Shelf, northwestern
	Atlantic and the size at onset of gonadal and morphometrical maturity
	was estimated. The spermatophores start to be formed in the end lobes
	of the testis. The vas deferens was divided into two different regions,
	based on its structure and function. The proximal region of the vas
	deferens is the site of the formation and storage of fully formed
	spermatophores, and seminal fluid, whereas the distal region is the
	site of the formation of the sperm plug components. Three physiological
	phases with two different chela height carapace width (Ch-CW) allometric
	relationships were found: phase I (immature bearing no spermatophore),
	phase 11 (adolescent bearing spermatophores in the vas deferens)
	with a common Ch-CW regression line, and phase III (adult bearing
	well developed vas deferens producing the components of the sperm
	plug) with an abrupt change in the Ch-CW regression line. The size
	at the onset of 50% gonadal and morphometric maturity occurred at
	68.5 mm and 127.6 mm CW, respectively. The current minimum size limit
	for commercial exploitation is set at 121 and 130 mm CW in Bay of
	Fundy and Scotian Shelf Jonah crab fisheries, respectively. Consequently,
	it is strongly recommended to increase the minimum harvestable size
	to protect reproductive potential of the stocks. Although the evidence
	presented in this paper may be enough to recommend the minimum size
	increase with the precautionary approach, more robust evidence is
	needed, on a rigorous scientific basis, to clearly link the morphometric/gonadal
	maturity with the functional one.},

	Bay of Biscay anchovy. Close to 100% of the anchovy population reach
	maturity during the reproductive season, although the smallest 1-year-old
	anchovy mature slightly later. At peak spawning, however, the reproductive
	output (numbers of eggs laid daily per unit body weight) of one year
	oil anchovy is similar to that of older anchovy. Anchovy mainly spawn
	from 19:00 to 6:00 (GMT) with a peak at 00:00 (GMT). For the females
	spawning on a given night, the final maturation process of the spawning
	batch of oocytes starts the night before. The process of nuclear
	migration proceeds through the night and the first parr of the following
	day. Oocytes start to hydrate early in the afternoon of the day of
	spawning. Hydration reaches its maximum intensity at dusk and in
	the early night. Gonads with postovulatory follicles can already
	be observed before dusk, indicating the start of spawning activities.
	Anchovy is a batch spawner with indeterminate fecundity. 'De novo'
	vitelogenesis proceeds in immature oocytes during the reproductive
	season. Annual fecundity is determined by both the number of eggs
	laid per spawning (batch fecundity) and the number of spawnings per
	season (frequency of spawning and duration of the spawning season).
	Batch fecundity presents al increasing pattern as the season advances,
	from ca. 200 eggs/g in April, to ca. 500 and ca. 650 eggs/g in May
	and June respectively. The fraction of females spawning per day ranges
	from 18 to 33%, and increases as the season progresses. This high
	spawning frequency may be related to the relatively short spawning
	season. Assuming a two month protracted spawning season, the total
	reproductive output of Bay of Biscay anchovy can range between ca
	9,000 to ca. 11,000 eggs per unit gonad-free body weight (g).},

	vertical migrations from 50 to 150m. Since 1991, vertical migrations
	have been reduced or have become erratic, with capelin commonly located
	deeper in the water column (200+m) and closer to the seabed. Changes
	in vertical distribution initially coincided with the onset of a

	as waters warmed. Vertical distribution was examined with regard
	to potential habitat-selection factors, including capelin density,
	water temperature, fish size, maturity stage, and proximity of predators.
	Of these, only fish density and predator (Atlantic cod) presence
	were significant. Capelin occupied more of the water column when
	their density was high than when it was low, and they were found
	farther from the seabed in areas with cod than without. Results indicate
	that, during the 1990s, capelin should have been able to optimize
	vertical distribution and feeding. This is not consistent with reports
	of poorer capelin condition and size-at-age in the 1990s, suggesting
	that vertical distributions are likely a result of changes in other

	hypothesis. A modification of the size-advantage hypothesis, the
	expected reproductive success threshold model, proposes that sperm
	competition and size-fecundity skew can strongly affect reproductive
	pay offs. Size-fecundity skew occurs if a large female's fecundity
	is markedly higher than the aggregate of the other members of her
	social group and, together with paternity dilution from sperm competition,
	can produce situations in which large females benefit by deferring
	sex change to smaller females. Deferral by large females can create
	sex-size distributions characterized by the presence of large females
	and small sex-changed males, and it is precisely these distributions
	that the traditional size-advantage model cannot explain. We tested
	the predictions of the new model with the bucktooth parrotfish, Sparisoma
	radians, on coral reefs in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. Collections
	and spawning observations determined that the local environmental
	regime of S. radians is characterized by pervasive sperm competition
	(accompanying 30% of spawns) and factors that can produce substantial
	size-fecundity skew in social groups. Dominant male removal experiments
	demonstrate that the largest females in social groups often do not
	change sex when provided an opportunity. Instead, smaller, lower-ranking
	females change sex when a harem vacancy arises. This pattern of sex
	change is in contrast to virtually all previous studies of social
	control of sex change in fishes, but provides strong support for
	the general predictions of the expected reproductive success threshold

	It has been argued that the collapses were caused by poor recruitment

	the recruitment of year classes that should have contributed most
	to the spawning stock at the time of the collapse and recruitment
	levels in earlier years. A power analysis shows that we would have
	almost certainly detected an overall reduction of recruitment of
	20%. There are considerable differences in the abundance trends as

	catch at age data (called ''virtual population analysis'' [VPA])

	levels than do survey-based estimates in recent years. More important
	is the observation that from the early 1980s the VPA-based trend
	shows a decline where none is apparent in the survey-based trend.
	One explanation of these differences would be an increase in discarding
	of young fish as fishing mortality increased. We test the hypothesis
	that the mortality for young cod is unrelated to the fully recruited
	fishing mortality. This hypothesis is rejected; in each of the six
	stocks, high juvenile mortality was associated with high adult mortality.

	commercial fishery along the United States Atlantic coast. Black
	sea bass are managed under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation
	and Management Act and by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.
	Because the black sea bass is a temperate reef species and is unavailable
	to bottom trawlers, capture is limited to anglers and pot fisheries.
	The demand for black sea bass exceeds supply and the high market
	value has prompted researchers to evaluate its potential for commercial
	aquaculture. Reproductively, black sea bass are protogynous hermaphrodites,
	developing first as females and later, at 3-4 y of age, transforming
	into males. Early attempts at spawning black sea bass centered around
	artificial spawning, collecting adult black sea bass in spawning
	condition and hand-stripping both males and females. Later attempts
	focused on inducing ovulation by intramuscular injection of two hormones;
	human chorionic gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone releasing hormone
	analog (LHRHa) and hand stripping. Milford Laboratory and UMASS Dartmouth
	Laboratory, have used photothermal manipulation to induce spawning.
	Black sea bass were placed in tanks of ambient, flowing seawater
	(10 degree C). The day/night cycle was controlled by a timer that
	turned fluorescent lighting on and off. Lighting was adjusted every
	three days to simulate the day/night cycle that was occurring in
	nature until 15 h of light and 9 h of darkness was reached. When
	ambient temperature reached 18-20 degree C and the day/night cycle
	was 15 h of light and 9 h of darkness the black sea bass spawned.
	Fish were allowed to spawn in the tanks and embryos were collected
	on a 500- mu m screen or in a 800- mu m net. Fish were spawned under
	these conditions from mid-April to the middle of July at the Dartmouth
	Laboratory and from the end of May until the beginning of July at
	the Milford Laboratory. Percent viable embryos ranged from 0% (first
	eggs produced) to 100% (in the middle of the spawning season). We
	have also made observations on the spawning behavior of black sea
	bass in the course of our conditioning procedures. One dominant male
	(alpha) appeared to control spawning. The dominant male segregated
	other males and females in the tank (10 females to 5 males at Milford
	and 9 females to 5 males at UMASS). This one male prevented other
	males from mingling with the females. When spawning occurred a female
	would swim up to the alpha male and present herself. Both fish would
	move to a separate portion of the tank where the female would release
	eggs and the male would release milt. When spawning was complete
	the female returned to the other females and the alpha male positioned
	himself between the females and the other males.},

	the appearance of the ooplasm. Due to these modifications of oocyte
	morphology and due to oocyte migration, the morphology of the gonads
	changed distinctly during a spawning cycle. Five oocyte development
	stages were identified by light microscopy and related to a macroscopic
	system of four gonad development stages, that can be applied to whole

  abstract = {Understanding reproduction and recruitment is essential for the successful
	conservation of a species. An estimate of the fecundity of cunner
	Tautogolabrus adspersus is critical for assessing population dynamics
	and perturbation effects. In this study, we estimated length-, weight-,
	and actual age-specific fecundity relationships for cunner in Cape
	Cod Bay, Massachusetts. We used the gonadosomatic index to assist
	with selection of mature, prespawning-size fish for estimating fecundity.
	We then gravimetrically estimated fecundity for 205 fish 69-185 mm
	in total length that were collected in May and June 1994. Quadratic
	models on log(10)-transformed length and weight data each explained
	71% of the variance in fecundity, and age data explained 57% of the
	variance. In a test of age-specific fecundity precision, three age-specific
	models (actual age, age back-calculated from the von Bertalanffy
	equation, and a calculated age estimate that was expanded to include
	additional data) produced consistent fecundity estimates, Finally,
	a comparison of length-, weight-, and age-specific fecundity relationships
	showed few differences among the models, suggesting that the more
	easily obtained length-specific fecundity relationship (log(10)F
	= 24.954log(10)L - 5.348log(10)L(2) - 24.421; R-2 = 0.71) is appropriate

	that Atlantic sardine were reproductively active mainly from October
	to March and that residual activity occurred in the remaining months.
	For both sexes, condition indices (hepatosomatic index, relative
	weight, and amount of fat stored) increased mainly during spring,
	reached a maximum at the end of summer just before the subsequent
	spawning season began, and then decreased during autumn and winter,
	declining to minimum levels at the beginning of spring coincident
	with a significant reduction in reproductive activity. Somatic growth

	The observed seasonal patterns in these biological properties suggest
	a seasonal transition from a period in which energy resources are
	allocated to reproduction (autumn and winter) to a period in which
	resources are allocated to growth and fat deposition (spring and
	summer). The only exception was the distinct hepatosomatic index
	pattern and the histological differences in hepatocytes between males
	and females during the spawning season, which may be related to the
	dual function of the liver in females (lipid metabolism and yolk

	1978-2000. The stock-recruit relationship was re-examined by three

	Sea in 1995 include cod spawned in the southern Kattegat and Oresund.
	Further qualitative evidence for the occurrence of "western recruits"
	in the Bornholm Sea is provided by a model of wind-driven water transport.
	This gives rise to two questions of essential importance for the
	assessment and management of Baltic cod stocks: 1) How large is the
	proportion of recruits of Belt Sea origin in the eastern Baltic cod
	stock? 2) Do these cod return to the Belt Sea at maturity, or do
	they remain in the eastern stock and adapt their reproductive rhythm
	accordingly (i. e. do western recruits enhance the eastern stock)?
	The proportion of western recruits in the area of the eastern Baltic
	cod stock was estimated from cod length distributions in annual trawl
	surveys of ICES subdivisions 22, 24 and 25 conducted in February
	and November of each year. The analyses show that in the eastern
	Baltic stock 15 % to 45 % of the cod aged 2 or 3 years, and 10 %

	a net eastward migration of western recruits after settling. The

  abstract = {By estimating probabilistic reaction norms for age and size at maturation,
	we show that maturation schedules of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua)
	off Labrador and Newfoundland shifted toward earlier ages and smaller
	sizes during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when these populations
	underwent a severe collapse in biomass and subsequently were closed
	for directed commercial fishing. We also demonstrate that this trend
	towards maturation at younger ages and smaller sizes is halted and
	even shows signs of reversal during the closure of the fisheries.
	In addition, our analysis reveals that males tend to mature earlier
	and at a smaller size than females and that maturation age and size
	decrease with increasing latitude. Importantly, the maturation reaction
	norms presented here are robust to variation in survival and growth
	(through phenotypic plasticity) and are thus strongly indicative
	of rapid evolutionary changes in cod maturation as well as of spatial
	and sex-specific genetic variation. We therefore suggest that maturation
	reaction norms can provide helpful reference points for managing
	harvested populations with evolving life histories. (English) [ABSTRACT

	but evolutionary biologists have typically regarded the energy costs

	and male–male combat. Adders (Vipera berus) offer an ideal model
	system in which to quantify the relative costs of spermatogenesis
	(and associated physiological preparations for reproductive activity)
	versus the costs of overt reproductive behaviours, because (i) these
	two activities occur sequentially rather than simultaneously, and
	are separated by a clear indicator (sloughing of the skin); and (ii)
	males do not feed during either of these phases. Hence, the rate
	of mass loss by males can be used as an index of energy costs. Surprisingly,
	the rate of mass loss is at least as high during the phase when males
	are immobile, building up sperm supplies, as when they move about
	and engage in reproductive behaviour. Rates of mass loss are not
	significantly correlated with male size or measures of the male's
	participation in reproductive activities. Our data suggest that sperm

  abstract = {Many marine invertebrates and fishes have a lunar or semi-lunar reproductive
	cycle. There are several possible explanations for the advantages
	of reproductive rhythmicity. Such rhythmicity may (1) increase the
	rate of mating; (2) increase the rate of fertilization; (3) help
	to retain free-living larvae in nursery sites; (4) help to spread
	free-living larvae over some adult habitats; (5) decrease predator
	pressure on free-living larvae; or (6) increase reproductive success
	by the direct influence of lunar cyclic environmental effects such
	as moonlight. In this study, the adaptive significance of reproductive
	rhythmicity in increasing the reproductive rate, is examined by analyzing
	the model which has three major controlling parameters, i.e. population
	density, sex ratio, and the duration of breeding interval. The objective
	function, that is adaptiveness, of per capita oviposition number

	snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) from the eastern Bering Sea (EBS)
	has contracted dramatically to the north. An increase in near-bottom
	temperature (NBT) during 1975-1979 was accompanied by a northward
	contraction of the cold pool (bound by the 2 degrees C NBT isotherm)
	that extends over the Middle Domain during the summer. Warming was
	tracked with a 6-year lag by a contraction to the north of the mature
	female's range. Snow crab settle and grow to maturity in the Middle
	Domain. Successful recruitment during cold regimes may result from
	the occurrence of spring blooms and the stenothermy of early benthic
	instars. However, recruitment to the mature female population did
	not expand back to the southern shelf after the mid-1990s, despite
	some years when NBT was low. Cross-correlation of year-to-year shifts
	in geographic distribution of cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and immature
	snow crab during the 1990s suggests that the northward expansions
	of cod controlled the southern boundary of snow crab's distribution
	range. Reestablishment of crab populations in the south may be hindered
	by cod predation. Also, because spawning females are now located
	"up-current," advection of larvae to the south is unlikely. Contraction
	to the north may not be followed by an expansion back to the south
	after a change in regime. We refer to this suggested asymmetry as
	the environmental ratchet hypothesis and discuss it in the context
	of other conceptual models of the EBS ecosystem.},

	We measured the gonadosomatic index, plasma estradiol, testosterone,
	and vitellogenin concentrations, and follicle diameters of fish collected
	from Orange Lake, Florida (USA). Additionally, the reproductive stage
	of the ovary was resolved histologically. We observed a seasonal
	pattern in reproduction. Following a quiescent period in the summer,
	there was an increase in sex steroid hormones during the fall, associated
	with the onset of vitellogenesis and active oogenesis. During the
	February collection, we directly observed ovulation in several females.
	This observation was supported by a sharp decrease in the gonadosomatic
	index between February and March as well as a decline in plasma hormones
	to basal levels during the summer months. Our data suggest the Florida
	gar has a group-synchronous ovary and the majority of females spawned
	during the early spring, followed by a general decrease in reproductive
	parameters to summer levels. While hormone and vitellogenin peaks
	may vary annually and variations in these reproductive patterns are
	expected for different collection sites, this study is important

	were collected for reproductive analyses along the Norwegian coast
	prior to the spawning seasons of 1997-2000. Over this time period
	there was a marked change in weight (W) at length (TL) with 1998
	showing extremely low values and 2000 high values in a historical
	perspective. Potential fecundity, amounting to about 20000-100000
	developing (vitellogenic) oocytes per fish and positively related
	to fish size, increased significantly with fish condition. Relative
	somatic potential fecundity (RFP, number of oocytes per g ovary-free
	body weight) in NSS herring was found to vary by 35-55% between years.
	Unexpectedly, females in 2000 showed low RFP-values, possibly due
	to negative feedback from previous reproductive investments at low
	condition. A clear threshold value for Fulton's condition factor,
	K (K = 100 x W/TL3), of 0.65-0.70 existed below which there was considerable
	atresia (resorption of vitellogenic oocytes). Thus, these components
	of the spawning stock, amounting to 1-46% in the period 1980-1999,
	obviously contributed relatively little to the total egg production.
	This was confirmed by low ovary weights and examples of delayed oocyte
	development in these individuals. An up-to-date atresia model is
	presented. The established oocyte growth curve, and to a lesser degree
	the assumed atretic oocytic turnover rate, was critical for the estimation
	of realised fecundity (number of eggs spawned). Modelled realised
	fecundity was significantly below observed potential fecundity. Females
	that had migrated the shortest distance from the over-wintering area,
	Vestfjorden, northern Norway, were in the poorest condition, had
	the least developed oocytes and the lowest potential and realised
	fecundities. In agreement with previously published studies on temporal
	and spatial changes in gonad weights, those females reaching the
	main spawning grounds in the south-western part of the coast (More)
	were the most successful ones in terns of egg production. Likewise,
	present results on oocyte diameter confirmed that repeat spawners
	spawn first and recruit spawners second. Our histological analyses
	on oocyte microstructure provided further evidence that oocyte size
	is a precise and accurate maturation criterion in herring. The methodological
	examinations also showed that the level of atresia as well as potential
	fecundity from oocyte and ovarian size can be estimated by the binocular
	microscope. This study shows that there is a large range in size-
	and condition-specific egg production in NSS herring, which should
	be taken into account in further recruitment studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier

	females was inversely related to density of slimy sculpins. Fecundity
	ranged from 55 to 1,157 eggs among fish 55 to 127 mm long, and for
	similar-sized fish, fecundity was inversely related to density of
	slimy sculpins. Fecundity was about 50% higher at Olcott, where population
	indices of slimy sculpins were low, compared with Nine Mile Point
	where indices were much higher Somatic weight or total length were
	both good predictors of fecundity. Lipid content of slimy sculpins
	was lower in an area of high sculpin abundance than in an area of
	low sculpin abundance, suggesting that fecundity was a function of
	density-dependent food availability. In large aquatic ecosystems,
	samples from more than one area may be necessary to describe fecundity
	of a sedentary species like slimy sculpin, especially if fish densities
	vary considerably among geographic areas. Large geographic variations
	in fecundity may be an indicator of spatial imbalance of a species
	with its prey. Low fecundity may be a compensatory response of slimy
	sculpins to low food supplies, thereby limiting population growth.},

	reproductive activity expanded to the southern area, three main spawning
	aggregations being observed. In the late March, isolated spawning

	In general, males were more abundant than females except in January,
	when large numbers of larger females arrived on the spawning ground.
	In late March, the oldest females left the area while a large number
	of immature fish arrived from the nursery ground located south of
	the study area. The Patagonian hake showed a main reproductive peak
	in January-February, when about 10% of females had hydrated oocytes

	Because they venture into the ocean in a pre-pubertal state and reproduce

	and sexual maturation is expected. Many swimming trials have been
	performed in 22 swim tunnels to elucidate their performance and the
	impact on maturation. European eels are able to swim long distances
	at a cost of 10-12 mg fat/km which is 4-6 times more efficient than
	salmonids. The total energy costs of reproduction correspond to 67%
	of the fat stores. During long distance swimming, the body composition
	stays the same showing that energy consumption calculations cannot
	be based on fat alone but need to be compensated for protein oxidation.
	The optimal swimming speed is 0.61-0.67 m s(-1), which is similar
	to 60% higher than the generally assumed cruise speed of 0.4 m s(-1)
	and implies that female eels may reach the Sargasso Sea within 3.5
	months instead of the assumed 6 months. Swimming trials showed lipid
	deposition and oocyte growth, which are the first steps of sexual
	maturation. To investigate effects of oceanic migration on maturation,
	we simulated group-wise migration in a large swim-gutter with seawater.
	These trials showed suppressed gonadotropin expression and vitellogenesis
	in females, while in contrast continued sexual maturation was observed
	in silver males. The induction of lipid deposition in the oocytes

	While controlling populations expanding linearly or exponentially
	is straightforward, intervention in systems with complex dynamics
	can have complicated, and sometimes counterintuitive, consequences.
	Most invasive plant populations are stage-structured and density-dependent
	a recipe for complex dynamics-and yet few population models have
	been created to explore the effects of control efforts on such species.
	We examined the demography of the invasive biennial plant Alliaria
	petiolata (garlic mustard) on the front of its spread into a natural
	area and found evidence of strong density dependence in vital rates
	of first-year rosette and second-year adult stage classes. We parameterized
	a density-dependent, stage-structured projection model using field-collected
	data. This model produces two-point cycles with alternating years
	in which adults vs. rosettes are more prevalent. Such population
	dynamics match observations in natural populations, suggesting that
	these complicated population dynamics may result from deterministic
	rules. We used this model to evaluate simulated management strategies,
	including herbicide treatment of rosettes and clipping or pulling
	of adult plants. Management of A. petiolata by inducing mortality
	of either rosettes or adults will not be effective at reducing population
	density unless the induced mortality is very high (>95% for rosettes
	and >85% for adults) and repeated every year. Indeed, induced mortality
	of rosettes can be counterproductive, causing increases in the stationary
	distribution of A. petiolata density. This species is typical of
	many invasive plants (stage-structured, short-lived, high fertility)
	and exhibits common forms of density dependence. Thus, the management
	implications of our study should apply broadly to other species with
	similar life histories. We suggest that management should focus on
	managing adults rather than rosettes, and on creating efficient control
	in targeted areas of the population, rather than spreading less efficient
	efforts widely.},

	surface-reflected path differences, and relative range of successive
	calls by individuals. Discrete vocal characteristics of the tone-burst
	frequency and sound-pressure levels assisted the determination of
	caller identification. Calibration signals were located within a

	error estimates, were produced for 213 calls during a sample 4-min

  abstract = {The timing of the reproductive cycle of the atipa, Hoplosternum littorale
	(Hancock, 1828), in ponds (batches of fishes) or in cages (isolated
	couples), is similar to that observed under natural conditions. Recordings
	of nests and spawning show a reproductive cycle ex;tending from early
	November to the end of May. The reunion of spawners during the second
	part of the breeding season does not extend the reproductive cycle.
	The high density of fry in the ponds, a few months after the first
	spawnings, might lead to the interruption of reproduction. The breeding
	of isolated couples shows : a decrease in the spawn weight from the
	first to the third spawning to a stable value (28.5 to 23.9 g for
	females of average weight 89 g, and 66.7 to 21.9 g for females with
	average weight 207 g). The number of spawnings for a female can reach
	14 over the complete reproductive cycle. The mass of eggs laid in
	one annual cycle by a single female, can be 180 g (48 600 eggs) for
	one weighing 89 g and 340 g (91 900 eggs) for one of 207 g weight.
	These estimations for the number of eggs, founded on die weight of
	an egg of 3.7 mg established in the present paper, are far beyond
	what had been previously mentioned. The average loss of weight of
	males (0.4 % of initial weight for 185 g and 9 % for 292 g males)
	and females (10 % of initial weight for 89 g and 23 % for 207 g females)
	over a complete reproductive cycle shows the extent of the investment
	of both sexes in reproduction. In ponds, 48 % of the nests are not
	used for spawning. The high proportion of nests without spawn is
	observed during the periods preceding and following the period of
	maximum spawning activity (January-February). There is no relation
	between the proportion of nests without spawn and rainfall. 49 %
	of the nests hold eggs laid by at least 2 females. Five or more females
	can spawn in the same nest. The conclusion attempts to integrate
	the presents results in a general view of the reproductive strategy
	of the atipa. It points out the need for detailed ethological studies

	little progress has been made in our understanding of previtellogenic

	growth has increased substantially in recent years. This new information
	pertains to the multiplicity of vitellogenin (Vg) genes, the oocyte
	Vg receptor, Vg processing enzymes (cathepsins) and their specific
	yolk products, and synthesis of various vitelline envelope precursor
	proteins in liver and ovary. Oocyte acquisition of lipids from sources

	perciformes, yet our understanding of the basic processes involved
	remains rudimentary. Considerable advances also have been made in
	our understanding of the endocrine regulation and mechanisms of ovarian
	follicle maturation. We have learned that ovarian follicle maturation
	involves a number of events including luteinizing hormone (LH)-dependent
	acquisition of oocyte maturational competence, LH induction of maturation-inducing
	hormone (MIH) synthesis, and MIH-dependent meiotic resumption (nuclear
	maturation) and cytoplasmic maturation. While much has been learned
	about mechanisms of maturational competence, MIH synthesis and meiotic
	resumption, our knowledge of cytoplasmic maturation is limited to
	descriptions of MIH-dependent yolk protein hydrolysis and associated
	oocyte hydration in a few species. It has become apparent that ovulation
	requires genomic activation regulated by nuclear MIH receptors, but

  abstract = {In the tropics, there is very little information on fish reproduction
	in intermittent streams and most of the studies are from the neotropic
	regions. In temporary rivers, environmental conditions are sharply
	contrasted and the variation amplitude of hydrological and physicochemical
	characteristics is high. In the Baoule River (Mali), during the peak
	of the dry season, the remaining pools comprise only 10% of the total
	length of the river. During the wet season, there is a short (three
	months) but intense period of flooding. In this study, the reproductive
	strategies of 18 species of fishes were investigated in the upper
	reach of the Baoule drainage. They belong to eight families, show
	variation in feeding guilds, and vary in size and habitat preferences.
	Fishes were collected from February 1985 to November 1988 using gillnets.
	Two main types of spawning strategies may be distinguished among
	these species. The first, the 'total spawners', have generally a
	short annual spawning period just before the flood. The second, the
	'small-brood spawners', produce small batches of eggs at frequent
	intervals for most of the year. Most of the species inhabiting the
	Baoule River exhibit a breeding strategy in relation to the flood
	seasonality. This type of strategy, common in harsh but predictable
	environments, favours a synchronous reproduction in phase with the
	optimal environmental conditions and the production of large number
	of juveniles that require no parental care. Concerning the Baoule
	River, 12 variables related to life-history theory were measured
	for 18 species. Clustering of these species based on Euclidean distances
	resulted in two groups. The first corresponds to developed parental
	care, large oocytes and low fecundity (about a hundred eggs). Two
	species, Chrysichthys auratus and Sarotherodon galilaeus, belong
	to this 'equilibrium strategy'. Others species have a 'seasonal strategy',
	which is adapted to the harsh local conditions. In the Nilo-Sudanian
	area, most fishes appeared to be associated with a seasonal life
	history strategy that exploits an annual expansion of aquatic production.
	In the Baoule River, the 'seasonal strategy' is characterised by
	high fecundity, absence of parental care, limited breeding season
	and for some species large adult size and upstream spawning migrations
	to floodplains.},

	effects on the growth of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua larvae and juveniles.
	Eggs were collected during the spawning season from spawning pairs

	Newly hatched larvae were released simultaneously into two mesocosms
	of 2500 and 4400 m3. Larval growth was monitored by sampling over
	a 10 week period, after which juveniles were transferred to on-growing
	tanks, where they were tagged and kept for up to 2 years. Maternal
	origin was determined by individual microsatellite genotyping of
	the larvae (n = 3949, 24 families) and juveniles (n = 600). The results
	showed significant positive correlations between egg size and larval
	size during the whole mesocosm period. Correlations, however, weakened
	with time and were no longer significant at the first tank-rearing
	sampling at an age of 9 months. Significant family-specific differences
	in growth were observed. The coefficient of variation (c.v.) was
	calculated in order to examine variation in standard length of larvae
	during the mesocosm period. Inter-family c.v. was on average 69%
	of intra-family c.v. Differences in zooplankton densities between
	the two mesocosms were reflected in larval growth, condition factor
	and c.v. Low food abundance appeared to reduce c.v. and favour growth
	of larvae that showed relatively slow growth at high food abundance.
	It is suggested that genetically determined variation in growth potential
	is maintained by environmental variability.},

	survival. The impact of a changing environment on spawning patterns
	is, however, poorly understood. A novel approach is to consider the
	impact of the environment on individual life histories and subsequent
	spawnings. In the present work, we extend the Dynamic Energy Budget
	(DEB) theory to investigate how environment variability impacts the
	spawning timing and duration of a multiple-batch spawning species.
	The model is successfully applied to reproduce the growth and reproduction
	of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in the Bay of Biscay. The model
	captures realistically the start and ending of the spawning season,
	including the timing of the spawning events, and the change in egg
	number per batch. Using a realistic seasonal forcing of temperature
	and food availability derived from a bio-physical model, our simulation
	results show that two thirds of the total spawned mass already accumulates
	before the start of the spawning season and that the condition factor
	increases with body length. These simulation results are in accordance
	with previous estimations and observations on growth and reproduction
	of anchovy. Furthermore, we show how individuals of equal length
	can differ in reproductive performance according to the environmental
	conditions they encounter prior to the spawning season. Hatch date
	turns out to be key for fecundity at age-1 as it partly controls
	the ability to build up reserves allocated to reproduction. We suggest
	the model can be used to realistically predict spawning in spatially
	and temporally varying environments and provide initial conditions
	for bio-physical models used to predict larval survival.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a study designed to ascertain the importance
	of variations in transport of cod eggs and larvae on the northeast
	Newfoundland Shelf. The distribution of cod eggs and larvae is described
	from a series of ichthyoplankton surveys. The mean and variance in
	surface currents were estimated from five experiments in which clusters
	of drogued satellite-tracked drifters were released at the presumed
	northern limit of the stock's range. These data were used to project
	the patterns of drift both backward and forward in time and thus
	the possible sources and destinations of eggs and larvae. Considering
	the development from the youngest (stage I) to the oldest stages
	(larvae), we saw a north-to-south and an offshore-to-inshore progression
	in spatial patterns of spawning and a continuing increase in the
	overall level of dispersion with increasing age of offspring. The
	data do not support the hypothesis that coastal or offshore areas
	represent simple sources or sinks of cod eggs and larvae. Transport
	plays an important but highly variable role that is coupled to the
	spawning distribution of adult fish and the availability of suitable
	conditions or habitats when the young begin to undergo metamorphosis
	and settle.},

	of about $16.9 billion USD to global fisheries values annually, i.e.
	20% of the global ex-vessel catch values of all marine fisheries
	combined. While the global catch value of forage fisheries was $5.6
	billion, fisheries supported by forage fish were more than twice
	as valuable ($11.3 billion). These estimates provide important information
	for evaluating the trade-offs of various uses of forage fish across
	ecosystem types, latitudes and globally. We did not estimate a monetary
	value for supportive contributions of forage fish to recreational
	fisheries or to uses unrelated to fisheries, and thus the estimates
	of economic value reported herein understate the global value of
	forage fishes.},

	and components of mortality (i.e., fishing and natural) that are
	frequently of interest to fisheries biologists. Recommended strategies
	include (1) use closed population models (e.g., Lincoln-Peterson)
	to estimate population size for short term studies where closure
	assumption can be met, (2) use the robust design to estimate population
	size for studies of longer duration, (3) use high-reward tags in
	conjunction with other methods of estimating reporting rate in tag-return
	studies, (4) combine a subset of telemetry tagged fish with either
	a high-reward tagging program or a traditional capture-recapture
	study to improve mortality estimates and understanding of mortality
	components, and (5) use pilot studies and simulation analyses to
	assess precision of estimated parameters to evaluate study feasibility.
	Incorporation of these improved techniques could lead to greater

	spawning within a reproductive season. Changes in developmental stages
	of gametes during testicular development and the presence of all
	gamete stages (excluding spermatogonia), in partially and fully spermiated
	males, indicated multiple group synchronous gamete development in

	index (GSI) provided a useful basic measurement of gonadal anabolism.
	Seasonal changes in gonad stage and GSI indicated that S. lalandi
	lalandi were spring-summer spawners. Blood plasma concentrations

	are now emerging that require many common perceptions about sunfish

	that ocean sunfish are an inactive, passively drifting species seems
	to be entirely misplaced. Technological advances in marine telemetry
	are revealing distinct behavioural patterns and protracted seasonal

	have been documented and broad-scale surveys, together with molecular
	and laboratory based techniques, are addressing the connectivity
	and trophic role of these animals. These emerging molecular and movement
	studies suggest that local distinct populations may be prone to depletion
	through bycatch in commercial fisheries. Rising interest in ocean
	sunfish, highlighted by the increase in recent publications, warrants
	a thorough review of the biology and ecology of this species. Here

  abstract = {The paper explores the climate-dependent evolution of marine Antarctic
	fauna and tries to identify key mechanisms involved as well as the
	driving forces that have caused the physiological and life history
	characteristics observed today. In an integrative approach it uses
	the recent concept of oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance
	to identify potential links between molecular, cellular, whole-organism,
	and ecological characteristics of marine animal life in the Antarctic.
	As a generalized pattern, minimization of baseline energy costs,
	for the sake of maximized growth in the cold, appears as one over-arching
	principle shaping the evolution and functioning of Antarctic marine
	ectotherms. This conclusion is supported by recent comparisons with
	(sub-) Arctic ectotherms, where elevated levels of energy turnover
	result at unstable, including cold temperatures, and are related
	to wide windows of thermal tolerance and associated metabolic features.
	At biochemical levels, metabolic regulation at low temperatures in
	general, is supported by the cold compensation of enzyme kinetic
	parameters like substrate affinities and turnover numbers, through
	minute structural modifications of the enzyme molecule. These involve
	a shift in protein folding, sometimes supported by the replacement
	of individual amino acids. The hypothesis is developed that efficient
	metabolic regulation at low rates in Antarctic marine stenotherms
	occurs through high mitochondrial densities at low capacities and
	possibly enhanced levels of Arrhenius activation energies or activation
	enthalpies. This contrasts the more costly patterns of metabolic
	regulation at elevated rates in cold-adapted eurytherms. Energy savings
	in Antarctic ectotherms, largely exemplified in fish, typically involve
	low-cost, diffusive oxygen distribution due to high density of lipid
	membranes, loss of haemoglobin, myoglobin and the heat shock response,
	reduced anaerobic capacity, large myocytes with low ion exchange
	activities, and the use of lipid body stores for neutral buoyancy.
	Important trade-offs result from obligatory energy savings in the
	permanent cold: low metabolic rates support cold-compensated growth
	but imply narrow windows of thermal tolerance and reduced scopes
	for activity. The degree of thermal specialization is not uniformly
	defined by cold temperature but varies with life style characteristics
	and activity levels and associated aerobic scope. Trade-offs for
	the sake of cold compensated growth parallel reduced capacities for
	exercise performance, exacerbated by the effect of high haemolymph
	magnesium levels in crustaceans and, possibly, other invertebrates.
	High magnesium levels likely exclude the group of reptant decapod
	crustaceans from Antarctic waters below 0 degrees C. The hypothesis
	is developed that energy savings imposed by the permanent cold bear
	specific life history consequences. Due to effects of allometry,
	energy savings are exacerbated at small body size, favouring passive
	lecithotrophic larvae. At all stages of life history, reduced energy
	turnover for the sake of growth causes delays and low rates in other
	higher functions, with the result of late maturity, fecundity and
	offspring release, as well as extended development. As a consequence,
	extended life spans evolved due to life history requirements. At
	the same time, polar gigantism is enabled by a combination of elevated
	oxygen levels in cold waters, of reduced metabolism and of extended
	periods of growth at slow developmental rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier

  abstract = {Effects of global warming on animal distribution and performance become
	visible in many marine ecosystems. The present study was designed
	to develop a concept for a cause and effect understanding with respect
	to temperature changes and to explain ecological findings based on
	physiological processes. The concept is based on a wide comparison
	of invertebrate and fish species with a special focus on recent data
	obtained in two model species of fish. These fish species are both
	characterized by northern and southern distribution limits in the
	North Atlantic: eelpout (Zoarces viviparus), as a typical non-migrating
	inhabitant of the coastal zone and the cod (Gadus morhua), as a typical
	inhabitant of the continental shelf with a high importance for fisheries.
	Mathematical modelling demonstrates a clear significant correlation
	between climate induced temperature fluctuations and the recruitment
	of cod stocks. Growth performance in cod is optimal at temperatures
	close to 10 degreesC, regardless of the population investigated in
	a latitudinal cline. However, temperature specific growth rates decrease
	at higher latitudes. Also, fecundity is less in White Sea than in
	North and Baltic Sea cod or eelpout populations. These findings suggest
	that a cold-induced shift in energy budget occurs which is unfavorable
	for growth performance and fecundity. Thermal tolerance limits shift
	depending on latitude and are characterized by oxygen limitation
	at both low or high temperatures. Oxygen supply to tissues is optimized
	at low temperature by a shift in hemoglobin isoforms and oxygen binding
	properties to lower affinities and higher unloading potential. Protective
	stimulation of heat shock protein synthesis was not observed. According
	to a recent model of thermal tolerance the downward shift of tolerance
	limits during cold adaptation is associated with rising mitochondrial
	densities and, thus, aerobic capacity and performance in the cold.
	especially in eurythermal species. At the same time the costs of
	mitochondrial maintenance reflected by mitochondrial proton leakage
	should rise leaving a lower energy fraction for growth and reproduction.
	The preliminary conclusion can be drawn that warming will cause a
	northern shift of distribution limits for both species with a rise
	in growth performance and fecundity larger than expected from the
	Q(10) effect in the north and lower growth or even extinction of
	the species in the south. Such a shift may heavily affect fishing
	activities in the North Sea.},

	to examine the use of commercial vessels to increase sampling density

	in the spring. The commercial vessel caught more fish than the survey
	vessel in both seasons. Catches of nearly all species were contagiously
	distributed in the spring. Most were contagiously distributed in
	the fall; however, somewhat more species were characterized by random
	or even distributions. The variance-to-mean ratio was consistently
	higher for most species for commercial vessel catches, regardless
	of season. As both vessels sampled in the same region at the same
	time, the increased predilection for the survey vessel to assess
	the distribution pattern as less patchy than the commercial vessel
	must accrue from some difference in sampling dynamics rather than
	variation in species distribution. A simulated decrease in sampling
	effort from 59 to 30 or 15 hauls increased the variance-to-mean ratio.
	Reduced sampling effort increased the tendency for occasional large
	catches to vary the estimate of domain biomass. The sampling program
	included an onshore-offshore gradient in station density. Domain
	biomass was considerably underestimated with reduced station density
	for six species characterized by large catches offshore in that portion
	of the survey domain characterized by low station density. In this
	study, a factor of two variation in domain biomass became more likely
	in 40% of species when sampling effort was reduced to 15 hauls from
	59. A factor of two in biomass may distinguish a sustainable. fishery
	from one in which a species is over. shed. As survey sampling effort
	in this area was 18 hauls, increasing sample number by inclusion
	of commercial vessel tows would be advantageous. A regression between
	paired tows failed to adequately predict catches of one vessel from
	catches of the other. Standardization of vessel catches by the ratio-of-mean
	catches provided a more realistic comparison because large catches
	accounted for a significant fraction of domain biomass; however,
	a single conversion coefficient between boats could not be used for
	both sampling periods. The underlying impediment in developing a
	general conversion factor between the two vessels seems to be rooted
	in the differential in variance-to-mean ratios of the catches; this
	differential exists despite sampling of the same distribution of
	fish.},

  abstract = {In contrast to generally sparse biological communities in open-ocean

	We investigated the origin of this apparent biological enhancement
	over a segment of the North Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) using sonar,
	corers, trawls, traps, and a remotely operated vehicle to survey
	habitat, biomass, and biodiversity. Satellite remote sensing provided
	information on flow patterns, thermal fronts, and primary production,
	while sediment traps measured export flux during 2007-2010. The MAR,
	3,704,404 km 2 in area, accounts for 44.7% lower bathyal habitat
	(800-3500 m depth) in the North Atlantic and is dominated by fine
	soft sediment substrate (95% of area) on a series of flat terraces
	with intervening slopes either side of the ridge axis contributing
	to habitat heterogeneity. The MAR fauna comprises mainly species
	known from continental margins with no evidence of greater biodiversity.
	Primary production and export flux over the MAR were not enhanced
	compared with a nearby reference station over the Porcupine Abyssal
	Plain. Biomasses of benthic macrofauna and megafauna were similar
	to global averages at the same depths totalling an estimated 258.9
	kt C over the entire lower bathyal north MAR. A hypothetical flat
	plain at 3500 m depth in place of the MAR would contain 85.6 kt C,
	implying an increase of 173.3 kt C attributable to the presence of
	the Ridge. This is approximately equal to 167 kt C of estimated pelagic
	biomass displaced by the volume of the MAR. There is no enhancement
	of biological productivity over the MAR; oceanic bathypelagic species
	are replaced by benthic fauna otherwise unable to survive in the
	mid ocean. We propose that globally sea floor elevation has no effect
	on deep sea biomass; pelagic plus benthic biomass is constant within

	fishery resource in European waters with a catch potential of about
	500,000 tomes. Since 1977 the spawning stock size has been estimated
	every 3 years using the annual egg production method (=total fecundity
	method). In 1989 the daily egg production method (=batch fecundity
	method) was applied for the first time. Daily egg production in the
	middle of the spawning season was estimated from a subset of the
	data collected for the regular annual production survey. Fish were
	captured by trawl for measurement of batch fecundity and daily spawning
	fraction. The daily egg production method gave a biomass estimate
	15% higher than the annual egg production method. This could be explained
	by a loss of eggs from the potential fecundity during the course
	of the season. The daily egg production method overcomes the problem
	of indeterminate fecundity in this species and requires only one,
	instead of five plankton surveys. Suggested improvements to the annual
	production method to measure changes in annual fecundity incur penalties
	in ship-time requirement. It is concluded that in the future, on
	the grounds of improved precision and lower cost, the daily egg production
	method will be preferred for estimation of biomass in this species.},

  abstract = {A population of the Hawaiian coral-reef goby, Asterropteryx semipunctata,
	was sampled over a 12-month period to determine basic demographics
	and reproductive parameters. The sexes did not differ in median length
	or weight, although the largest males were considerably longer and
	heavier than the largest females. Overall adult sex ratio was 1 :
	1; monthly sex ratios did not differ from unity except in June, when
	there was a significant female bias. Minimum age at maturity (17.5-19
	mmSL) was estimated to be 4.5-5 months after hatching. Nearly all
	fish over 22 mm SL were mature. Mature females were found in all
	months of the year, and females that showed evidence of recent or
	imminent spawning were collected in every month except December.
	Gonadal analyses indicated a peak in breeding during the summer (
	May July) and minimal spawning during the winter ( January February).
	Between 20% and 30% of females showed evidence of having spawned
	within the 24-h period prior to collection; therefore, it was estimated
	that females spawned, on average, at least once every five days and
	perhaps as frequently as every three days. Mean batch fecundity was
	708 eggs (+/-418), and was not well predicted by standard length,
	body weight, or somatic condition. Relative batch fecundity ( mean
	= 1.44 oocytes mg(-1) somatic wet weight) varied seasonally, with
	higher values in spring and summer ( April July) than in fall and
	winter ( September January). Reproductive parameters are compared
	and contrasted with those of other gobiid fishes to elucidate general
	differences between temperate and tropical species.},

	In anadromous salmonids, it is unclear whether the allocation patterns
	are determined by the growing conditions experienced when the fish
	are in freshwater or at sea or by the female's reproductive history.
	We collected data on length, egg size, and fecundity from female
	steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss that had spent 1 year in freshwater
	and then 2 (designated 1.2) or 3 years at sea (1.3) before spawning
	for the first time. We also collected the same data from females
	spawning for the second time but of the same age as those spawning
	after 3 years for the first time (1.1S1). The older females were
	longer than the younger ones, but there was considerable overlap
	in length. The repeat-spawning fish were shorter than fish of the
	same age that were spawning for the first time, which reflected the
	reduction in growth associated with the previous spawning migration
	and reproductive event. Fish length was positively correlated with
	egg size and fecundity, but the 1.2 females had smaller eggs for
	their size than did the 1.3 fish, which implied an effect of growth
	rate at sea. We then measured scales from a subset of the fish as
	an index of individual fish size at the time of seaward migration
	and size after their first year of growth at sea. Fish that matured
	first after 2 years at sea were slightly larger as smolts but grew
	significantly more in their first year at sea than did those maturing
	a year later. However, neither measure was related to egg size or
	egg number after adjustment for length. The processes controlling
	the egg size-fecundity trade-off in steelhead and other salmonid
	species remain unclear, but the present evidence is incompatible
	with the hypothesis that growth in freshwater as juveniles determines
	reproductive trade-offs at maturity by females.},

	method was used to estimate the number of eggs spawned in each sampled

	us to accurately estimate total population size and individual variance

	individuals are included in the analysis. Excluding non-breeders
	resulted in the true variation in RS being underestimated and the

	The total number of valid hauls (3 h each) was 31 and 42 in the first
	and second period. respectively. The two chosen periods allowed the
	whole dimensional span of the red shrimp (from 12 to 70 mm of carapace
	length, CL) to be covered. The 20 mm mesh cod-end (the minimum legal
	size by Italian by-laws) catches all the adult red shrimps (CL >
	35-40 mm), with only a minimal fraction of the juveniles passing
	through (CL50 = 18-19 mm SF = 0.9). The 24 mm mesh cod-end permits
	the greater fraction of the juvenile component (CL50 = 21 mm SF =
	0.9) to escape, whereas the 28 mm mesh cod-end still captures the
	greatest majority of the adults, while allowing a substantial part
	of the juveniles (CL50 = 23-24 mm; SF = 0.83-0.87) to escape. The
	main conclusions are: (1) neither the mesh presently in use in the
	Strait of Sicily (16-18 mm) nor the legal mesh (20 mm) are satisfactory
	in the biological sensed (2) the introduction of a cod-end with a
	mesh of 28 mm (side) is strongly recommended; (3) management interventions
	other than mesh regulation are required, given that not even the
	28 mm cod-end achieves a CL50 near the size at onset of maturity
	estimated for the red shrimp of the Strait of Sicily (about 40 mm
	CL). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	stages of marine fish larvae. Lipids in broodstock nutrition are
	considered to be important for the quality of the larvae. Lipids
	affect the spawning and the egg quality of many fish species and
	a deficiency in (n - 3) highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in
	broodstock negatively affects fecundity, fertilization rate and hatching
	rate of the species studied. Lipids as a source of energy at the
	embryonic and larval stage (before first-feeding) are evaluated in
	relation to other sources of energy such as protein and carbohydrates.
	After hatching and prior to first-feeding, some marine species show
	a preference in catabolizing phosphatidylcholine, whereas phosphatidylethanolamine
	tends to be synthesized. The effect of long-term (LT) and short-term
	(ST) enrichment techniques on the lipid composition of rotifers has
	been documented using various marine oils/emulsions. The quantitative
	and qualitative lipid class and fatty acid composition of diets influenced
	the lipid and fatty acid composition of both LT- or ST-enriched rotifers.
	The nutritional improvement of Artemia is also important and may
	follow the general methods used for rotifers. The functions of docosahexaenoic
	acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) during early stages of
	marine fish larvae are apparently different. High amounts of EPA
	in relation to DHA may create an imbalance in the structural composition
	of the phospholipids, which could affect the normal growth and the
	quality of the larvae. Turbot larvae tended to exhibit lower pigmentation
	success with lower DHA:EPA ratio in the total lipid fraction of the
	larvae, especially when the absolute amounts of EPA were high compared
	to those of DHA (in the total lipid and phospholipid fraction of

	can have an effect on population densities, and in some extreme cases
	a positive feedback between an increasingly male-biased sex ratio
	and female harassment may theoretically even bring about population
	extinction. The results of this study, and the literature reviewed,

	consequences of size-selective harvesting and natural selection in

	The phenotypic criterion is defined by a threshold that specifies
	the minimum size of individuals harvested, while the demographic
	goal defines the desired catch or escapement from the harvest. Models
	use either a constant phenotypic threshold, or a variable phenotypic
	threshold that moves each year to remain a fixed distance from the

	yield or escapement, measured in abundance or biomass. We find that

	produce evolutionary changes in equilibrium mean size and abundance
	when harvesting is size selective. Reductions in mean size are more
	severe under harvesting scenarios for which it is not possible to
	fully satisfy the demographic goals of harvesting at equilibrium.
	Models with a variable phenotypic threshold always produce a characteristic
	equilibrium for mean size and abundance for a given set of harvesting
	and natural selection parameters, regardless of the initial population

	in Baltic sprat Sprattus sprattus and relates the onset of maturity
	at Age 1 to the larval traits that are tied to the formation of the
	first increment. From the otolith microstructure analyses in larvae
	we found that regular deposition of increments is closely related
	to larval length, the first clear increment being identified at 16
	mm length. Otolith distance from the centre to the first clear increment
	was independent of temperature, whereas the width of subsequent regular
	increments increased with increasing temperatures. These results
	are interpreted in the context of the interaction of larval length,
	somatic growth and environmental temperature. The date of first increment
	formation was further estimated in mature and immature Age 1 sprat
	caught from 1998 to 2000 using a technique that we developed, based
	on the effect of temperature on larval-stage otolith microstructure
	after first increment formation. The overall result was that larvae
	that reach the length of 16 mm early (late) in the season in warm
	years are more (less) likely to mature the following year. In cold
	years, like 1998, the probability of maturating at Age 1 was independent
	of the date at which larvae became 16 mm long, and other processes
	such as juvenile growth rates, feeding conditions and year-class
	abundance are suggested as factors that may influence the onset of

  abstract = {We have previously documented multiple, independent origins of placentas
	in the fish family Poeciliidae. Here we summarize similar analyses
	of fishes in the family Zenarchopteridae. This family includes three
	live-bearing genera. Earlier studies documented the presence of superfetation,
	or the ability to carry multiple litters of young in different stages
	of development in the same ovary, in some species in all three genera.
	There is also one earlier report of matrotrophy, or extensive postfertilization
	maternal provisioning, in two of these genera. We present detailed
	life-history data for approximately half of the species in all three
	genera and combine them with the best available phylogeny to make
	inferences about the pattern of life-history evolution within this
	family. Three species of Hemirhamphodon have superfetation but lack
	matrotrophy. Most species in Nomorhamphus and Dermogenys either lack
	superfetation and matrotrophy or have both superfetation and matrotrophy.
	Our phylogenetic analysis shows that matrotrophy may have evolved
	independently in each genus. In Dermogenys, matrotrophic species
	produce fewer, larger offspring than nonmatrotrophic species. In
	Nomorhamphus; matrotrophic species instead produce more and smaller
	offspring than lecithotrophic species. However, the matrotrophic
	species in both genera have significantly smaller masses of reproductive
	tissue relative to their body sizes. All aspects of these results
	are duplicated in the fish family Poeciliidae. We discuss the possible
	adaptive significance of matrotrophy in the light of these new results.
	The two families together present a remarkable opportunity to study
	the evolution of a complex trait because they contain multiple, independent
	origins of the trait that often include close relatives that vary
	in either the presence or absence of the matrotrophy or in the degree
	to which matrotrophy is developed. These are the raw materials that
	are required for either an analysis of the adaptive significance
	of the trait or for studies of the genetic mechanisms that underlie
	the evolution of the trait.},

	the end'of warm weather, stored fat, then utilized reserves to survive
	the winter and initiate reproduction the following spring. We hypothesized
	that this pattern of fat utilization was a life history adaptation
	that enabled the fish to acquire food resources in the autumn then
	allocate them to reproduction the following spring when the fitness
	of the young would be greater. Here we evaluate one aspect of this
	hypothesis by evaluating the probability of survival to maturity
	and fecundity of young as a function of date of birth. We placed
	cohorts comprising eight to ten litters of young born early-, mid-
	or late in the reproductive season in replicate field enclosures.
	The entire experiment was repeated in two different years. Early-born
	young had a significantly higher probability of survival to maturity
	but did not differ in fecundity relative to the last cohort of the
	season. Early-born young also attained maturity early enough to reproduce
	in the, ir year of birth while lateborn young had to overwinter before
	reproduction. The fitness consequences to the mother of either producing
	one more litter of young at the end of the season, versus instead
	storing fat and reproducing the following spring are not as determinate
	as are the effects of date of birth on offspring fitness. Females
	most often gain fitness by not producing one last litter and instead
	over-wintering. If, however, the overwinter survival of offspring
	is not influenced by their size at the end of the season, then a
	female's fitness could be enhanced by producing one more litter late
	in the season. If instead the probability of overwinter survival
	is strongly influenced by the size of offspring at the end of the
	season, then our results suggest that a female gains more by deferring
	reproduction and storing for overwinter survival and reproduction
	the following spring.},

	are seen in commercially exploited populations. Here, we compare
	the life histories of natural populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata)
	from Trinidad that live in either high- or low-predation environments,
	which serve as surrogates for the presence or absence of commercial
	fishing. We can quantify mortality rate and life history variables,

	We have manipulated mortality rates in nature and measured the rate
	of evolution. High mortality selects for earlier maturity at a smaller
	size, as observed in commercial fisheries and as predicted by theory.
	Furthermore, the nature and magnitude of predator-induced mortality
	are comparable to those caused by commercial fishing. The rate of
	evolution in guppies predicts similar evolution in commercial fisheries

	areas of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus (L.). This is an unusual
	reproductive strategy, since pelagic spawnings inside estuaries are
	uncommon. In order to contribute to the understanding of this reproductive
	strategy, a study of adult and planktonic phases of anchovy was undertaken
	in the Mondego river estuary (Portugal), where this species spawns
	almost exclusively in a brackish area of the upper estuary. This
	paper focuses on the daily period of spawning, the health condition
	of spawners, the batch fecundity, the spawning rate and the parental
	investment on reproduction. The daily spawning of the anchovy took
	place at dusk and during the first hours of darkness. Photoperiod:
	appears to be the most important factor determining the beginning
	of the daily spawning. The differences found in the absolute batch
	fecundity between age classes were only due to the differences in
	the average weight of each age class: no differences were found in
	the relative batch fecundity. During the reproductive season, the
	batch fecundity decreased, which reflects a reduction in the parental
	investment in reproduction due to the exhaustion of energetic reserves.
	With only one exception, the majority (>85%) of females caught in
	each sampling date spawned or would spawn simultaneously, i.e. in
	the same day. This high fraction of simultaneously spawning females,
	together with both the predominance of males in almost all samples
	and the absence of immature and atretic females, indicated that sampled
	anchovies only represent a small fraction of the overall anchovy
	population, from which spawning schools migrate frequently to the
	upper estuary and return.},

	All instances of non-annual spawning are described as one of three

	ripe eggs is caused by conditions experienced during the spawning
	season (fish density, mate availability, pollution), whereas failure

	experienced prior to the spawning season (primarily temperature and

	on non-annual spawning may be because of difficulties in identifying
	non-reproductive individuals. In an attempt to rectify this situation,
	the criteria needed to identify females undergoing the three forms
	of spawning omission are presented in terms of external appearance
	of gonads, gonad indices, and histological analysis. The energy saved
	by not spawning in a poor year may lead to increased survival and
	the probability of spawning in subsequent years. As the cumulative

	critical for understanding the mechanisms behind apparent stability
	observed in natural populations. The gynogenetic Amazon molly (Poecilia
	formosa) requires sperm from sexual males (e.g. Poecilia latipinna)
	to trigger embryogenesis, but inheritance is strictly maternal. Consequently,
	males should try to avoid or reduce the cost of mating with asexuals.
	We investigated male mate choice by documenting the presence of sperm
	in natural populations and found that a higher proportion of sexual
	females had sperm than asexuals. In addition, among those females
	that had sperm, sexuals had more sperm than asexuals. Our results

	is higher than paternal investment and that parental care does not
	limit the reproductive rate for males. In pumpkinseed sunfish, selection
	favors parents with high levels of defense that may exclude predators
	more effectively and, as suggested by Bateman's measures, alternative

	in poor condition) adopt a low pay-off phenotype as a 'best of a
	bad job'. Alternatively, reproductive polymorphisms can be maintained
	by balancing selection, with male phenotypes having equal fitnesses
	at equilibrium, but examples from nature are rare. Many species of
	sunfish (genus Lepomis) are thought to have alternative male reproductive
	behaviours, but most empirical work has focused on the bluegill sunfish
	and the mating systems of other sunfish remain poorly understood.
	We studied a population of pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus)
	in upstate New York. Field observations confirm the existence of
	two male reproductive strategies: 'parentals' were relatively old
	and large males that maintained nests, and 'sneakers' were relatively
	young and small males that fertilize eggs by darting into nests of
	parentals during spawning. The sneaker and parental male strategies
	appear to be distinct life-history trajectories. Sneaker males represented
	39% of the males observed spawning, and sneakers intruded on 43%
	of all mating attempts. Microsatellite analyses revealed that sneaker
	males fertilized an average of 15% of the eggs within a nest. This
	level of paternity by sneaker males appears to be higher than seen
	in most other fishes, and preliminary analyses suggest that the two
	male reproductive strategies are maintained as a balanced polymorphism.},

  abstract = {In marine invertebrates that spawn by simply releasing their gametes
	into the water (free-spawning), fertilization success likely is often
	limited by low sperm concentrations, due to dispersion of mates and
	dispersal of gametes by water movements. Production of large, low
	density eggs might be advantageous when sperm concentrations consistently
	are low, because large target size might increase egg/sperm encounters,
	and more low than high density eggs could be produced per clutch.
	Although average fertilization success in the labrid Thalassoma bifasciatum
	is similar to 95% in both group spawns (in which multiple males compete
	for fertilizations by producing large quantities of sperm) and pair
	(mono-male) spawns, it is slightly lower in pair spawns, due to low
	level sperm limitation that arises because pair-spawning males release
	near the minimum number of sperm necessary for maximum fertilization.
	I examined whether variation in egg size and content in T. bifasciatum
	and other free-spawning fishes is related to variation in spawning
	mode, to assess whether compensatory production of large, low-density
	eggs might be contributing to high fertilization success in pair
	spawns. I found no difference between the volume or density of eggs
	of (1) pair- and group-spawning females of T. bifasciatum, or (2)
	pair- and group-spawning congeneric species of labrids, scarids,
	and serranids, or (3) labrids and scarids with vigorous, rapid spawning
	movements (which could turbulently diffuse gamete clouds) and those
	with slow movements. Further, egg density does not decline with increasing
	egg volume among those fishes. Assuming that egg size can affect
	fertilization success, then sperm limitation seems unlikely to represent
	a significant problem for pair-spawning T. bifasciatum, probably
	because mates place their vents close together during gamete release.
	The situation regarding sperm limitation in other fishes, and effects
	of environmentally generated water turbulence on it, are less clear.
	Interspecific variation in the size and content of these fishes'
	eggs may relate to provisioning of offspring for different larval

	are measured with three indices: (i) evenness, (ii) the number of

	is parameterized for the Georges Bank and North Sea fish communities.
	The results suggest that there is no "optimal" size selectivity to
	maintain biodiversity: the effects of each exploitation pattern depend
	on the selectivity of the gear (i. e., the shape of the selection
	curve) relative to the available sizes. Catching a narrow range of
	species almost always reduced evenness and species richness more
	than taking the same catch from a broader range of species. In summary,
	neither selective nor nonselective fishing can be said to be generally
	preferable for conserving biodiversity; the outcome depends on the
	particular species composition and size structure of the community.
	Advice intended to inform management will need to be based on clear

  abstract = {The reproductive biology of the Jenyns's sprat Ramnogaster arcuata
	in the Rio de la Plata area was studied using macroscopic and histological
	analysis of ovaries. Samples were collected during two research surveys
	carried out in June 1998 and June 1999. In addition monthly occurrences
	of this species from historical data were analysed. Jenyns's sprat
	specimens were mainly observed in open waters of the estuary during
	winter months. Most of the females collected during June 1998 and
	1999 were in the spawning stage. This pattern differs from fish that
	reproduce in the estuarine waters of the Rio de la Plata, which spawn
	during spring and summer. These results suggest that conditions of
	productivity and larval retention in the estuary also remain during
	winter months. This characteristic might be useful for R. arcuata
	larvae in avoiding competition with other estuarine spawners. Jenyns's
	sprat is a multiple spawner with indeterminate annual fecundity.
	A preliminary estimate of spawning frequency (N = 220) indicated
	a daily percentage of females with postovulatory faollicles of 17-35
	%, which suggests that this species spawns on average once every
	six days. Batch fecundity, estimated from counts of hydrated oocytes
	from 40 females, ranged from 669 to 2026 hydrated oocytes in 1998
	and from 570 to 1830 hydrated oocytes in 1999. Batch fecundity was
	fitted to a linear function of total body weight (without ovary)
	in 1999. Mean relative fecundity was 234 hydrated oocytes per female
	gram (ovary free) in 1998 and 155 hydrated oocytes per female gram
	(ovary free) in 1999, and no significant relationship was observed
	between this parameter and female size. The dry weight of loo hydrated
	oocytes ranged between 3.9 and 6.3 mg, these values being significantly
	higher than those estimated for other species of the Rio de la Plata
	estuary.},

	variation in fish, with particular reference to the flatfishes: 1.
	genetic variation and evolutionary response; 2. the size and age
	at first reproduction; 3. adult lifespan and variation in recruitment;
	4. the relationship between reproductive effort and age. Evolutionary
	response may be limited by previous evolutionary pathways (phylogenetic
	variation) or by lack of genetic variation due to selection for a
	single trait. Estimates of heritability suggest, as predicted, that
	selection is stronger on life-history traits than morphological traits;
	but there is still adequate genetic variation to permit fairly rapid
	evolutionary changes. Several approaches to the analysis of the optimal
	age and size at first reproduction are discussed in the light of
	a general life-history model based on the assumption that natural
	selection maximizes r or R0. It is concluded that one of the most
	important areas of future research is the relationship between reproduction
	and mortality. Murphy's hypothesis that the reproductive lifespan
	should increase with variation in spawning success is shown to be
	incorrect for fish, at least at the level of interspecific comparison.
	The model of Charlesworth & Leon predicting the sufficient condition
	for reproductive effort to increase with age is tested: in 28 of
	31 cases the model predicts an increase of reproductive effort with
	age. These results suggest that, in general, reproductive effort
	should increase with age in fish. This prediction is confirmed in
	the 15 species for which adequate data exist.},

  abstract = {The last ICES Symposium on recruitment variability was field in Arhus,
	Denmark, in the summer of 1970. The 1970 symposium brought together
	many important ideas on the topic. A contemporary perspective on
	recruitment variability is developed based on (1) the post-1970 accumulated
	record and (2) many of the ideas tabled in 1970. A brief review focuses
	on the multidecadal nature of recruitment variability and the fact
	that recruitment and its integral, stock size, often vary quite independently
	from fishing mortality, providing a strong implication that multidecadal
	changes in the environment are a major cause of recruitment variability.
	This evokes the old issue of the need to separate the effects of
	fishing from the effects of the environment. An important pathway
	leading to such a separation was suggested at the 1970 symposium.
	This pathway involved the notion that an understanding of recruitment
	variability required examining non-linear interactions among fish
	life-history stages. However, an intellectual tension between the
	need to examine life-history stages and the need to study factors
	affecting the mortality of fish larvae became apparent. These two
	approaches are now brought together by linking survival at the egg
	and early larval stage with fecundity. This generates a recruitment-stock
	curve that exhibits a collapsed and a non-collapsed phase and couples
	directly, in principle, with the physical structure of the environment.

	all individuals in the group, (ii) with the subset of spawning sea
	trout only and (iii) with the subset of foraging, nonspawning individuals
	only, a subset that consisted primarily of sea trout caught during
	their first year at sea. For all three regional sea trout groups,
	a higher proportion of individuals (regardless of whether they were
	foraging or spawning) appear to have originated from the rivers that
	drain locally, than from the rivers that drain in other parts of
	the Limfjord. This suggests (1) that sea trout, at least during their
	first year at sea, undertake limited migrations within the Limfjord
	system and (2) that sea trout on their spawning run were caught close
	to their natal rivers. The proportion of sea trout of hatchery origin
	varied widely among all three Limfjord areas and broadly reflected
	regional stocking histories, with high proportions of sea trout of
	domestic origin in the east (39.3%), where stocking with domestic
	trout was practised intensely at the time of sampling, and in the
	west (57.2%), where a programme of coastal stocking of post smolts
	took place over several years in the early 1990s. In contrast, in
	the central Limfjord, where stocking with domestic trout was largely
	abandoned in the early 1990s, the proportion of sea trout of domestic
	origin was only 8.5%. Interestingly, for all three regional sea trout
	groups, virtually no sea trout of hatchery origin were found among
	the spawning individuals, which were on average larger than the nonspawning
	sea trout. These results suggest that stocked domestic brown trout
	that become anadromous experience high mortality at sea and are therefore
	largely absent among the larger, spawning individuals. We conclude
	that sea trout of domestic origin exhibit much reduced ability to
	reproduce and are unlikely to contribute significantly to the local
	gene pool largely because of a relatively high mortality at sea before
	the onset of maturity.},

	is sound in principle, it is incomplete as there are many solutions
	to the allocation of resources that derive from the trade-off between
	number and size. This paper examines evolutionary aspects of this
	trade-off in annual grain crops. The analysis is centred on the working
	hypotheses that, for a given species and environment, allocation
	of resources to reproduction involves (H1) high plasticity in seed
	number, which allows for variable resource availability, and (H2)
	a relatively narrow range of seed size that results from evolutionary
	and agronomic selection. Comparisons between crops and fish are used
	to highlight common evolutionary elements in taxa where parents provide
	little or no care to their offspring, with the consequence that both
	number and early survival of offspring, hence fitness of parents,
	are partially related to embryo size and reserves. The plasticity
	of seed number in relation to availability of resources is analysed
	against the established relationship between offspring number and
	parent growth rate during critical stages. The notion that seed size
	is under stabilising selection is analysed against three conditions:
	(1) mean seed size is conservative for a given species and environment,
	(2) seed size affects fitness, and (3) seed size is heritable. Databases
	from published papers were compiled to analyse the relative variability
	of seed size and number, and the heritability of seed size. Evidence
	for and against the link between seed size and parental fitness is
	revised using the Smith-Fretwell model as framework (Am. Nat., 108,
	499-506). The proposal of high plasticity of seed number and narrow
	variability of seed size resulting from stabilising natural selection
	is generally consistent with evolutionary and genetic considerations.
	Agronomic selection may have reinforced natural selection leading
	to relatively narrow seed size in species such as wheat and soybean,
	where cultivated types retained high plasticity for seed number.
	In contrast, selection for one or few inflorescences in crops like
	sunflower and maize may have morphologically reduced seed number
	plasticity and increased variability of seed size and its responsiveness
	to resource availability in relation to their wild ancestors.},

	models in which the effects of sink-limitation in the growth of organs
	and the loss of resources by maintenance respiration are taken into
	consideration. In these models, the resource absorption rate of an
	organ is proportional to either its absolute size or its surface
	area and either the initial size of an organ or the total initial
	size of the organs produced is fixed. In all models, organs are produced
	using a fixed amount of reserved resources and no additional resources
	become newly available for their growth. We theoretically show that
	size-number trade-offs are nonlinear if the resource absorption rate
	of an organ is proportional to the absolute size of the organ and
	the initial size of the individual organs is fixed or if the resource
	absorption rate of an organ is proportional to the surface area of
	the organ. In these nonlinear size-number trade-offs, the size of
	individual organs increases less rapidly than in linear trade-offs
	with a decrease in the number of organs and the total size of organs
	is an increasing function of the number of organs produced. This
	implies that increasing the number of organs produced is advantageous
	in terms of resource-use efficiency. In contrast, size-number tradeoff
	is linear if the resource absorption rate of an organ is proportional
	to the absolute size of the organ and there is a linear trade-off
	between the initial size of organs and their number. To exemplify
	the effects of those size-number trade-offs on the lift-history evolution,
	we calculate the optimal offspring sizes that maximize the number
	of offspring successfully being established. In the case of nonlinear
	size-number trade-offs. the optimal offspring sizes are smaller than
	the optimal offspring size in the case of linear size-number trade-offs,
	namely, that in the model of Smith and Fretwell (1974). Our optimal
	offspring size depends on the metabolism of organ development; the

	the growth curve of seeds and harvested seeds when they matured.
	The maximum gross growth rate of a seed had a strong positive effect
	on final seed dry mass, whereas the respiration cost had a strong
	negative effect on such mass. The total seed mass produced by a plant
	decreased with (or was independent of) an increase in the mean seed

	Short-term effects of growth and survival of year classes of cod
	and the effects of fishing were evaluated by using a modified version
	of a dynamic ecosystem model (DYNECOMAS II), originally developed
	for extensive mariculture purposes in Masfjorden, western Norway.
	Simulations indicated that the availability of zooplankton and density-dependent
	predation and cannibalism were key factors for the carrying capacity
	for cod in the fjord. On a short-term scale, there was a strong-density-dependent
	regulation of cod productivity, individual growth and survival, while
	fisheries had little impact. Long-term effects on the fitness of
	cod in relation to fishery and environmental variability were evaluated
	by means of a life history model. The intrinsic rate of increase
	r was chosen as a measure of fitness. The impact on cod fitness of
	maturation age, variable survival at egg, larval and 0-group stage
	(reflecting variable recruitment to age 1) and the degree of density-dependent
	growth were studied for different entry ages to the fishery for both
	moderate and high fishing intensities. A modified Euler-Lotka equation
	was parameterized using available empirical data on growth, age-dependent
	fishing mortality and fecundity for cod from Masfjorden and DYNECOMAS
	II model-predicted natural mortality for juveniles (predation mortality).
	The solution (r) was found by iteration for combinations of maturing
	age, fishing mortality and survival probability until 1 year of age.
	The predictions obtained were that (a) the lower the survival probability
	until 1 year of age, the lower the fitness; (b) the higher the maturing
	age the lower the fitness; (c) an early entry to even a moderate
	fishery resulted in r<0 for low survival probability to age 1; (d)
	if a high degree of density-dependent growth was associated with
	an early entry to an intensive fishery (F=1) from age 1 year and
	onwards, the surviving individuals from an average year class may
	not produce enough replace spawners regardless of maturing age, since

	success in food competition when given a restricted amount of food.
	Active feeding behaviour and larger energy allocation to storage
	tissues, as suggested by the higher increase in condition, represents
	adaptations to the high-latitude environment for northern cod and
	countergradient variation. These differences suggest the existence
	of genetically distinct sub-populations along the Norwegian coast.
	Development of sub-populations that differ in behaviour and life-history

	initial juvenile size; and larger juveniles, which hatch from larger
	eggs, have lower mortalities, experience faster growth, and take
	less time to become adults. Under these assumptions, as parental
	care reduces instantaneous egg mortality, the optimal egg size increases.
	This increase is expected both among and within populations. Thus,
	the general conclusion that each population should have a single
	optimal egg size (see, e.g., Smith and Fretwell 1974; Maynard Smith

  abstract = {A 14-year investigation of a North American Acipenseriform fish, the
	paddlefish Polyodon spathula in the Yellowstone River; Montana, and
	North Dakota, USA has provided a detailed empirical framework of
	the life history in relation to the costs of reproduction for that
	species and potentially for closely related sturgeons. Nearly all
	aspects of life histories of males and females differed from each
	other after the immature period. The five periods in the juvenile
	and adult life histories for males and females, which occur at different
	ages for each sex, were (I) immature, (2) maturing, (3) somatic growth
	and reproduction, (4) prime reproduction, and (5) senescence to death.
	During the first period (immature), fishes exhibit rapid somatic
	growth as well as accumulation of energy reserves in the form of
	gonadal fat bodies (GFBs) and other fat deposits. During the second
	period (maturing), somatic growth slows as production and stored
	energy reserves are diverted into reproduction. In the third period,
	fish are allocating energy to both somatic growth and reproduction.
	Reproductive periodicity is typically close to two years for males
	and three years for females; gonadal recrudescence is slower than
	in older fish. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) is increasing, and GFBs
	are depleted over 2-3 spawns in females and reduced more gradually
	in males. Fish make longer pre-spawning migrations upriver: In the
	fourth period (prime reproduction), somatic growth is slow or negative,
	as energy is routed more strongly into reproduction. GSI is at a
	maximum; GFBs are completely depleted in females. Reproductive periodicity
	is typically one year for males and two years for females; the rate
	of gonadal recrudescence is at its maximum. Fish make shorter pre-spawning
	migrations upriver: In the fifth period (senescence to death), GSI
	of some of the oldest females decreases; the oldest males have few
	energy reserves and are long and lean. Distinct male female differences
	in life histories were consistent with theoretical models and with
	empirical observations of the lack of direct male competition for
	females. The framework outlined for this paddlefish stock may exist
	among other Acipenseriform fishes and is potentially useful for evaluating
	their life histories.},

  abstract = {The reproductive biology of yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares,was
	investigated by sam- pling 19,990 fish caught by purse-seine vessels
	throughout the eastern Pacific Ocean during October 1987 through
	September 1989. Histological examinations of ovaries from 7,121 females
	and testes from 7,077 males provided the foundation for the estimates
	of length-specific repro- ductive characteristics. Spawning was widespread
	from 26°N to 14°S and from the coast to 140°W, the western edge
	of the fishery. Between 0° and 20°N spawning occurred continuously
	through- out the year, with no pronounced seasonal patterns in intensity.
	North of 20°N spawning took place primarily during July through
	November, when sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) exceeded about 24°C.
	South of 0° spawning occurred during November through February,
	again when SSTs exceeded about 24°C. The proportions of reproductively-active
	females found within an area were correlated with monthly SSTs. 85.3%
	of the spawning occurred between 26°C and 30°C. Spawning occurs
	almost entirely at night between 2200 h and 0600 h. For the fish
	caught between 0° and 20°N, the estimated length at which 50% of
	the fish were mature was significantly less for males (69 cm) than
	for females (92 cm). For both females and males captured between
	0° and 20°N, the estimated lengths at which 50% are mature are
	shorter for fish captured west of 110°W. The esti- mated average
	batch fecundity, based on counts of migratory-nucleus and hydrated
	stages of oocytes, was 2.5 million oocytes, or 67.3 oocytes per gram
	of body weight. Significant spatiotem- poral differences were found
	in the relationships between batch fecundity and length. The frac-
	tion of mature females with postovulatory follicles was 0.66, indicating
	the average female spawned every 1.52 d. The fraction of mature females
	caught between 0° and 20°N which had pos- tovulatory follicles
	was significantly higher west of 110°W (0.79) than east of 110°W
	(0.58), indi- cating that spawning rates may be higher west of 110°W.
	There was a positive nonlinear rela- tionship between the fraction
	of mature females spawning per day and length. Sex ratios based on
	histological information indicated that the overall sex ratio did
	not deviate from 1:1. However, there was a preponderance of females
	in the length class of 50 to 54.9 cm, and a preponderance of males
	in the length classes greater than 134.9 cm.},

	role as a primary forage species for several top-level predators
	in these systems, very little is known about their behavioral interactions
	with predators and the vulnerability of post-larval life stages to
	predation. In this study, we examined the vulnerability of juvenile
	bay anchovy to age-0 bluefish predation using a size-structured laboratory
	design. For a range of bay anchovy and bluefish body sizes, we determined
	predator capture success, handling time costs, feeding rates, and
	prey profitabilities as functions of relative prey size, We evaluated
	bluefish size selection when offered different sizes of bay anchovy
	simultaneously and identified behavioral characteristics of prey
	that may contribute to disparate rates of attack. Bluefish capture
	success was high on small relative prey sizes (< 30 % of predator
	size) and remained high on larger relative prey sizes (> 50 % of
	predator size), demonstrating that even large bay anchovy are highly
	susceptible to capture, Handling time and capture success relationships
	were combined with prey body mass to generate dome-shaped profitability
	curves that peaked at relative prey sizes of 0.50, which is much
	higher than typically observed for piscivore-prey interactions, Bluefish
	exhibited strong selection patterns and significantly higher attack
	rates on large bay anchovy. Disparate attack distributions on large
	and small bay anchovy appeared to be caused partly by differences
	in prey behavior among size groups. Our results suggest that bay
	anchovy may not achieve a refuge from predation with increased body
	size and support the importance of predation in shaping bay anchovy

	to capture and yielded high profitability compared to Atlantic silverside
	and age-0 striped bass prey. Variation in capture success among forage
	species was particularly influential in generating disparate profitability
	functions. Although morphological differences among forage species
	contributed to variation in susceptibility to predation, behavioral
	analyses indicated that variable reaction distances to approaching
	predators and activity levels of prey may explain a large fraction
	of the observed differences in susceptibility. When several forage
	species were offered to predators simultaneously in larger enclosures,
	mortality was highest and occurred earlier for bay anchovy and Atlantic

	energy in the Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), an annual estuarine
	fish. Previous research revealed that northern silversides are subject
	to strong size-dependent winter mortality, while southern fish suffer
	no appreciable winter mortality. To examine whether there was geographic
	differentiation in allocation strategies, we compared temporal patterns
	of energy storage and utilization among three populations along this
	gradient in seasonality. The comparative design used monthly or biweekly
	samples of fish collected in the wild, as well as samples of fish
	from each population reared in a common environment, where genetic
	differences can be clarified. Somatic energy stores were quantified
	via gravimetric analysis of neutral storage lipids and lean tissue.
	Analysis revealed that small individuals maintained relatively low
	levels of lipid reserves, which may account for their lower survival
	in winter. Wild fish in the north rapidly accumulated large somatic
	reserves, which were depleted over the winter and then increased
	again during the subsequent spring breeding season. In wild southern
	fish, relatively small reserves accumulated slowly until breeding
	commenced in the spring. The common-environment comparison of somatic
	storage patterns revealed a genetic basis for among-population differences
	in reserve accumulation rates, but no differences in the amount of
	reserves stored. We conclude that the overwinter depletion of somatic
	reserves has a significant selective impact on energy accumulation
	and allocation strategies in seasonal environments.},

	for the offspring of first-time spawners, intermediate-aged females,

	category were middle aged to old. Females up to 44 years of age still
	had viable eggs and a reproductive life of at least 29 years. Fecundity

	due to fishing mortality will also lead to a 4 weeks shorter spawning
	season and a 2 weeks shift in the date of peak spawning. The effect

  abstract = {Factors contributing to population growth through strong year-class
	formation have driven a century of directed research in fisheries
	science. A central discovery of Hjort's paradigm was that multiple
	generations overlap and longevity is matched with frequency of strong
	recruitments. Here, I elaborate on this tenet by examining how intra-population
	modalities in spawning and early habitat use favour population resiliency.
	A modem theory that has application is the storage effect [Warner,
	R.R., Chesson, P.L., 1985. Coexistence mediated by recruitment fluctuations
	- a field guide to the storage effect. Am. Nat. 125, 769-787], whereby
	spawning stock biomass accumulates each year so that when early survival
	conditions are favourable, stored egg production can result in explosive
	population growth. I review two early life history behaviours that
	contribute to the storage effect: split cohorts (i.e., seasonal pulses
	of eggs and larvae) and contingent behaviour (i.e., dispersive and
	retentive patterns in early dispersal). Episodic and pulsed production
	of larvae is a common feature for marine fishes, well documented
	through otolith microstructure and hatch-date analyses. In temperate
	and boreal fishes, early and late spawned cohorts of larvae and juveniles
	may have differing fates dependent upon seasonal and inter-annual
	fluctuations in weather and climate. Often, a coastal fish may spawn
	for a protracted period, yet only a few days' egg production will
	result in successful recruitment. In these and other instances, it
	is clear that diversity in spawning behaviour can confer resilience
	against temporal variations in early survival conditions. Although
	many factors contribute to intra-population spawning modalities,
	size and age structure of adults play an important role. Contingent
	structure, an idea dating to Hjort (herring contingents) and Gilbert
	(salmon contingents), has been resurrected to describe the diversity
	of intra-population modalities observed through otolith microchemical
	and electronic tagging approaches. Retentive and dispersive behaviours
	confer resiliency against early survival conditions that vary spatially.
	Examples of contingent structure are increasingly numerous for diadromous
	fishes. Here, a nursery habitat associated with a contingent behaviour
	may make a small contribution in a given year, but over a decade
	contribute significantly to spawning stock biomass. For flatfish
	and other marine fishes, contingent structure is probable but not
	well documented. Proximate factors leading to contingent structure
	are poorly known, but for diadromous fishes, time of spawning and
	early life history energetic thresholds is hypothesized to lead to
	alternative life cycles. Here again time of spawning may lead to
	the storage effect by hedging against spatial variance in early vital
	rates. Managing for the storage effect will be promoted by conservation
	of adult age structure and early habitats upon which both strong
	and weak year-classes rely. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	differences reflected the underlying hydrographic regime. The correlation

	The models reveal conditions under which males can maximize daily

	for collecting and counting the number of sperm and eggs released

	The method was used to examine the pattern of sperm allocation for
	pair- and group-spawning males. The number of sperm released by pair-spawning
	males varied positively with the number of eggs released by their
	female mates and with female body size. The data suggest that males
	economize on sperm release by providing the minimum amount of sperm
	needed to fertilize the egg clutch of the female partner. Fertilization
	efficiency (the number of eggs fertilized by a given number of sperm)
	was higher with large females than it was with small females. Males
	differed significantly among themselves in sperm output per spawn,
	with some males consistently releasing more sperm than other males
	with same-sized females. Male-male differences were not due to differences
	in male body size, quality of the spawning site, or the apparent
	degree of water movement. The number of sperm released per spawn
	did not decline throughout the daily spawning period, a pattern that
	disproved one but not all possible patterns of sperm depletion. Tn
	group spawns, the total number of sperm released and the number released
	per male were respectively 50 and 6 times the number released in
	pair spawns, on average. Both of these measures increased significantly
	with the clutch size of the spawning female. Overall, sperm production
	is probably sufficiently costly that males have been selected to
	allocate sperm carefully among their frequent daily spawns.},

	capacity of a stock (e.g., total fecundity) to subsequent recruitment.
	The Beverton-Holt spawner-recruit function, perhaps the most widely
	used, is conventionally parameterized using a "steepness" parameter
	that describes the stock's productivity. This parameter highly influences
	predicted population dynamics and responses to exploitation. Unfortunately,
	steepness can also be difficult to estimate reliably from data typical
	of stock assessments. In such cases, estimation can be improved by
	drawing inference from other stocks with similar life-history patterns.
	In particular, Bayesian prior distributions can formally be incorporated
	into stock assessments to inform estimation of steepness. In the
	present study, we used a meta-analytic approach to compute a prior
	distribution of steepness, focusing on marine demersal fishes. We
	similarly computed a prior distribution of maximum lifetime reproductive
	rate, a parameter inextricably related to steepness. In addition,
	we tested relationships between steepness and two life-history parameters
	linked to longevity-natural mortality and age at maturity-to examine
	the common assumption that long-lived, "K-selected" species have
	lower steepness values. In neither case was steepness significantly
	related to the life-history parameter. Our results should be directly
	applicable in stock assessments that apply the Beverton-Holt (or
	Ricker) function to marine demersal fishes, such as reef-associated

	the effective fitness is w(e) = w - sigma(2)/N, where w is the mean
	fitness, sigma(2) is the variance in offspring number, and N is the

	The aim was to monitor maturity changes in the inshore fjords of
	Disko Bay over an extended period from winter to autumn and compare
	these findings with specimens from Baffin Bay and the presumed spawning
	area in Davis Strait. A significant difference in maturity level
	was observed in and between the three areas. In Disko Bay maturity
	indices increased significantly in August and September both with
	respect to the gonado-somatic index (I-G) and the size in the leading
	oocyte cohort. In the period February to May no significant changes
	were observed. Mature ovaries were only observed among fish >80 cm
	total length and only among a fraction of these large fish. Offshore
	areas of Baffin Bay, even though poorly sampled, showed similar signs
	in the maturity indices as in Disko Bay. Relative to Disko Bay and
	Baffin Bay, female fish in Davis Strait had more progressed maturity
	indices. Furthermore, almost all fish in Davis Strait showed signs
	of progressed maturity contrary to Disko and Baffin Bay. A large
	proportion of the Greenland halibut in Disko and Baffin Bay apparently
	did not begin the maturation cycle until very late in their life
	history or were repeat spawners with a multi-year maturation cycle.
	These observations could thus support the hypothesis that Greenland
	halibut have a prolonged adolescent phase. Atresia was highest in
	the early phases of maturation in Greenland halibut but relatively
	high levels of atresia were also observed in fish in more advanced
	maturity phase. The first was ascribed to fecundity regulation while
	the latter could be linked to the fish's fitness condition but it
	was not possible to show this with the available condition index.

	populations located in the Coast Range of California produced small
	clutches of large eggs compared to populations from more southern
	locations (as little as 60 km farther south). A similar tradeoff
	between clutch size and egg size was observed among individuals within
	a population, females that lay large eggs tend to produce small clutches;
	on a seasonal basis, females laid smaller clutches consisting of
	larger eggs later in the reproductive season. Injections of ovine
	follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) into vitellogenic females increased
	the mean clutch size (from 4.2 to 6.0 eggs) with a concomitant decrease
	in egg mass (from 0.43 to 0.33 g). By contrast, a surgical reduction
	of clutch size (yolkectomy of two follicles) caused an increase in
	egg mass (from 0.43 to 0.53 g)-egg shape changed (elongation) with
	egg hypertrophy. This increase in egg mass was due largely to increased
	yolk; hatchlings from these hypertrophied eggs were proportionately
	heavier than those from control eggs. Egg size was independent of
	the time course of follicular development (time to oviposition from
	the onset of yolking averaged 29 days). These complementary manipulations
	indicate that (1) the number of eggs in the clutch is under the control
	of circulating plasma gonadotropin concentrations, and (2) the size
	of eggs is set by the number of follicles undergoing vitellogenesis
	and finally ovulated. Moreover, the effect of manipulations was dependent
	on the stage of vitellogenesis: production of large clutches of small
	eggs did not occur in females if administration of FSH commenced
	when follicles were above approximately 4-5 mm in diameter (ovulation
	normally occurs at 8 mm), and some females undergoing yolkectomy
	during early vitellogenesis recruited new follicles.},

	patterns at larger scales requires a different approach. Researchers
	and managers need to determine the types of sampling gear and amount

	in a range of habitats across a catchment. * Using a randomized block
	design within a 90-m stream reach that contained the same habitats

	three different types of gear (minnow traps, backpack electrofishing,
	and hoop nets) at three levels of effort (one, two, and three mixed-gear

	body size of pelagic fishes along an oceanic depth gradient. We used
	a database on pelagic marine fishes native to the north-east Pacific
	Ocean between 40degreesN and 50degreesN. We used data from the Pacific
	Rim Fisheries Program that were obtained from commercial, management
	and scientific surveys between 1999 and 2000. Depth of occurrence

	409 species of pelagic fishes along a depth gradient from 0 to 8000
	in. A presence-absence matrix was used to classify the depth range
	of each species into 100-m intervals. Atmar & Patterson's (1995)
	software was used to quantify the degree of nestedness of species
	distributions. Pelagic fish species diversity decreased steeply with
	increasing depth; diversity peaked at less than 200 m and more than
	half of the species had mean depths of occurrence between 0 and 300
	m. The distribution of species showed a very strong nested subset

	occurred from near the surface to great depths. The relationship

  abstract = {Since the late 1980s, the Daily Egg Production Method (DEPM) has been
	applied to several anchovy stocks in European waters. DEPM surveys
	in the Bay of Biscay were well standardized and focused on providing
	fisheries-independent information for stock assessment purposes.
	Those targeting Mediterranean stocks were largely experimental and
	often opportunistic, with the main aim of developing and testing
	the method, rather than providing estimates of spawning stock biomass
	(SSB) for stock assessment. Consequently, the DEPM has been applied
	once, twice, or a maximum of three times in certain Mediterranean
	areas with no among-area standardization. Different techniques for
	several aspects of the method have been used in the Mediterranean,
	and the parameters estimated vary greatly among stocks and year of
	application. Evidence is provided that variability in biological
	production among sub-basins and/or years, a characteristic of Mediterranean
	Sea, may directly affect anchovy egg production. The daily specific
	fecundity of anchovy stocks can vary greatly among years, areas,
	or seasons in response to changing environmental and trophic regimes.
	When the correlation between regression-derived estimates of daily
	egg production and associated estimates of daily specific fecundity
	for anchovy in the Mediterranean, the Bay of Biscay, and upwelling
	areas are compared, a significant isometric relationship emerges
	for the Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay, implying density-dependent
	use of spawning habitat. In upwelling areas, estimates of daily egg
	production are relatively high for a narrow range of generally low
	daily specific fecundities. There is a strong linear relationship
	between anchovy SSB and spawning area in European waters that does
	not differ significantly between the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean
	Sea. (C) 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea,

  abstract = {The recently launched Daily Egg Production Method (DEPM) surveys to
	estimate the spawning stock biomass (SSB) of the northern Aegean
	Sea anchovy stock are presented and variability in plankton and adult
	parameters is analyzed for the yearly applications of 2003, 2004,
	2005, 2006 and 2008. Anchovy spawned mainly over the continental
	shelf of the Thracian Sea in the east (directly affected by Black
	Sea waters), and the semi-enclosed Thermaikos Gulf and Evoikos Gulf
	in the west. The surveyed area was therefore post-stratified into
	an eastern and western region and DEPM parameters, which, in certain
	years, differed markedly between the two areas, were estimated separately
	for the two strata. To increase precision of the daily egg production
	estimates, both eggs and yolk sac larvae were used assuming that
	the mortality rate does not change between the egg and yolk sac larval
	stage. Embryonic mortality increased as a power function of temperature.
	The estimation of spawning fraction was based on the postovulatory
	follicles (POFs) method and was particularly complicated due to the
	presence of strong thermoclines and diel vertical migration of the
	fish: POF absorption was very fast during the night, when fish were
	located above the thermocline (>20 degrees C), but relatively slow
	during the day, when fish were close to the bottom at similar to
	14-15 degrees C. Mean relative batch fecundity was significantly
	related to somatic condition (energy reserves) whereas spawning frequency
	was related to liver condition (presumably, direct food intake).
	In comparing daily specific fecundities (DSFs) with concurrent estimates
	of mesozooplankton biomass and total anchovy biomass (independently
	derived from acoustic sampling) evidence for strong density-dependence
	in DSF emerged. Density-dependent use (expansion-contraction) of
	the spawning habitat (SA), indexed by the ratio CV(SA)/CV(SSB), was
	relatively low but density-dependency of egg production CV(DSF)/CV(SSB)
	was particularly high in the N. Aegean Sea compared to the more productive

  abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests that some populations of benthic marine
	organisms may be less demographically 'open' than previously thought,
	The degree to which a population receives recruits from local sources
	versus other populations has important ecological and management
	ramifications. For either of these reasons, it is often desirable
	to estimate the degree to which a population of interest is self-recruiting.
	Although methods for actual estimation of population self-recruitment
	are limited and often difficult to employ, the presence of several
	biological and physical conditions may improve our estimates of self-recruitment
	for particular populations, Biological traits of benthic adults (relative
	fecundity, spatial and temporal patterns of spawning and larval release,
	parental investment), as well as pelagic larvae (stage of development
	at hatching, pelagic larval duration, vertical migration behavior,
	horizontal swimming ability, and sensory capabilities) influence
	where and when larvae are released, where and how they are transported,
	their ability to move actively in the pelagic realm, and finally,
	spatial and temporal settlement patterns. Physical variables potentially
	influencing self-recruitment include site isolation, coastal complexity
	and flow variability. Within these physical variables we discuss
	explicit mechanisms by which larvae may be retained in proximity
	to their natal population. We provide examples from specific locations
	such as coral reefs, isolated islands and seamounts, and semi-enclosed
	embayments such as lagoons and estuaries, as well as characteristic
	oceanographic features such as upwelling systems, fronts, moving
	convergences, eddies and counter currents. We evaluate direct and
	indirect evidence to predict the relationship between these biophysical
	variables and the degree of self-recruitment in benthic marine organisms.
	We conclude that physical factors that result in a departure from
	unidirectional, depth-uniform water flow provide the opportunity
	for retention of larvae, and therefore of self-recruitment. These
	physical factors are common in the ocean and vary in intensity among
	locations and times. Some enable retention of passive larvae (physical
	retention). whereas others lead to retention only with active behavioral
	input by the larvae (biophysical retention). Larval behavior that
	can contribute to or result in retention or return to natal sites
	ranges from simple vertical orientation (within the capabilities
	of the larvae of most taxa) to complex sensory abilities and strong
	swimming (known to occur in larvae of a few taxa, particularly decapod
	crustaceans and fishes). For all taxa. both the pelagic larval duration
	and the time to behavioral competency will have a strong influence
	on likelihood of self-recruitment. Understanding the biophysical
	mechanisms by which larvae are retained near or return to their natal
	population will be necessary before generalizations can be made.
	Examples highlight the importance of each variable to processes controlling
	self-recruitment. For most cot-relates, further study is clearly
	warranted. Although certain variables hold promise for predicting
	self-recruitment, complex, non-linear interactions among these biophysical
	variables must be considered.},

	reefs. Two families, wrasses (Labridae) and damselfishes (Pomacentridae),
	which accounted for 90% of all non-cryptic reef fish settlers, exhibited

	Species with longer seasonal recruitment periods exhibited higher

	reproductive output was reduced during the wet season, but this alone
	did not account for the low recruitment at this time. The lack of

  abstract = {This review organizes ideas on the evolution of life histories. The
	key life-history traits are brood size, size of young, the age distribution
	of reproductive effort, the interaction of reproductive effort with
	adult mortality, and the variation in these traits among an individual's
	progeny. The general theoretical problem is to predict which combinations
	of traits will evolve in organisms living in specified circumstances.
	First consider single traits. Theorists have made the following predictions:
	(1) Vhere adult exceeds juvenile mortality, the organism should reproduce
	only once in its lifetime. Where juvenile exceeds adult mortality,
	the organism should reproduce several times. (2) Brood size should
	maximize the number of young surviving to maturity, summed over the
	lifetime of the parent. But when optimum brood-size varies unpredictably
	in time, smaller broods should be favored because they decrease the
	chances of total failure on a given attempt. (3) In expanding populations,
	selection should minimize age at maturity. In stable populations,
	when reproductive success depends on size, age, or social status,
	or when adult exceeds juvenile mortality, then maturation should
	be delayed, as it should be in declining populations. (4) Young should
	increase in size at birth with increased predation risk, and decrease
	in .size with increased resource availability. Theorists have also
	predicted that only particular combinations of traits should occur
	in specified circumstances. (5) In growing populations, age at maturity
	should be minimized, reproductive effort concentrated early in life,
	and brood size increased. (6) One view holds that in stable environments,
	late maturity, multiple broods, a few, large young, parental care,
	and small reproductive efforts should be favored (K-selection). In
	fluctuating environments, early maturity, many small young, reduced
	parental care, and large reproductive efforts should be favored (r-selection).
	(7) But another view holds that when juvenile mortality fluctuates
	more than adult mortality, the traits associated with stable and
	fluctuating environments should be reversed. We need experiments
	that test the assumptions and predictions reviewed here, more comprehensive
	theory that makes more readily falsifiable predictions, and examination
	of different definitions of fitness.},

	the role of maternal nutritional and thermal history on egg quality

	therefore it was possible to track egg quality and hatching success
	over successive spawning episodes. A two-factor orthogonal experimental
	design, involving two feeding levels (high and low rations) and two
	temperatures (summer and winter), was implemented with half of the
	replicates used to explore embryonic development and the remaining
	half examining egg-yolk quality via fatty acid analysis. Differences
	in reproductive output and embryo mortality were largely attributed
	to maternal ration and not temperature. Females maintained on low
	ration produced smaller clutches, consisting of smaller eggs and
	exhibiting higher embryo mortality rates than high ration females.
	Both batch fecundity and relative hatching success declined over
	successive clutches. Lipid content was also significantly lower in
	low ration females, however, the relative quality in terms of lipid
	and fatty acid constituents was maintained regardless of treatment
	and spawning frequency. It is suggested that elevated embryo mortality
	rate in eggs spawned by low-fed females was a function of insufficient
	maternally derived yolk resources to fuel embryogenesis. Results
	indicate that maternal nutritional and reproductive history are important
	determinates for offspring survival, potentially having significant
	effects on the magnitude of subsequent recruitment events in squid
	populations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	to estimate parameters. No prior assumptions of homogeneity are used
	for the structure of the zero or non-zero values. The method is primarily
	applicable to fixed-station designs, although extensions to other

	= 0.015 m(3)); (2) PVC pipe bundle (volume = 0.004 m(3)); (3) rock
	aggregate (volume = 0.008 m(3)). Of the habitats, the most utilized
	habitat (62.9%) was the two-tier layered structure that allowed movement
	in all directions. The next utilized type was the pipe bundle (25.6%)
	with the openings inhabited by the largest juveniles in each tank.
	Overall, a mean of 18.2% of the fish were observed using habitats.
	Study 3 examined water velocities ranging from 0.01 to 0.12 m/sec.
	Most fish became concentrated in the tank bottom area having a water
	velocity in the range of 0.04-0.09 m/sec. At these velocities there
	were few aggressive interactions. Smaller fish inhabited the areas
	outside this velocity range. At the higher velocities, the small
	fish swam vigorously to maintain their position in the water column.
	At the low velocities, sporadic incursions of larger fish occurred
	presumably to attempt to cannibalize or to defend territory. Results
	from these studies help to define characteristics of nursery systems
	for rearing juvenile black sea bass.},

	demonstrated within species, it is not known if this pattern holds
	among species. We tested whether a large difference in egg size between
	congeneric seastars with contrasting planktotrophic and lecithotrophic
	modes of development results in differences in the likelihood of
	eggs being fertilised in sperm-limiting situations. Measurement of
	egg sizes and sperm swimming speeds led to the prediction that the
	sperm-egg collision rate constant for Patiriella calcar (420-mu m-diameter
	egg) should be nine times greater than for P. regularis (140-mu m-diameter
	egg). Although the eggs of P. calcar should be fertilised at greater
	rates in low sperm concentrations, they were not. When gametes were
	allowed to mix for 10 s, the hypothesis that P. calcar eggs required
	less sperm than P. regularis to ensure 50% of eggs were fertilised
	was rejected. When gametes were mixed for 5 min, P. regularis eggs
	were more frequently fertilised, but the difference was not statistically
	significant. We conclude there must be a difference between these
	species in the likelihood that when a sperm finds a conspecific egg
	it can successfully fertilise. This apparent uncoupling of egg size
	and likelihood of fertilisation suggests that fertilisation is not
	a major constraint on the evolution of egg size in these seastars.},

	adaptations to environmental forcing occurring from bottom-up and
	top-down processes. Such variation occurs not only among, but also
	within species, indicating demographic plasticity in response to
	environmental conditions. From a broad literature review, we present
	evidence for ocean basin- and large marine ecosystem-scale variation
	in intra-specific life history traits, with similar responses occurring
	among trophic levels from relatively short-lived secondary producers
	to very long-lived apex predators. Between North Atlantic and North
	Pacific Ocean basins, for example, species in the Eastern Pacific
	exhibited either later maturation, lower fecundity, and/or greater
	annual survival than conspecifics in the Western Atlantic. Parallel
	variations in life histories among trophic levels also occur in adjacent
	seas and between eastern vs. western ocean boundaries. For example,
	zooplankton and seabird species in cooler Barents Sea waters exhibit
	lower fecundity or greater annual survival than conspecifics in the
	Northeast Atlantic. Sea turtles exhibit a larger size and a greater
	reproductive output in the Western Pacific vs. Eastern Pacific. These
	examples provide evidence for food-web-wide modifications in life
	history strategies in response to environmental forcing. We hypothesize
	that such dichotomies result from frequency and amplitude shifts
	in resource availability over varying temporal and spatial scales.
	We review data that supports three primary mechanisms by which environmental
	forcing affects life history strategies: (1) food-web structure;
	(2) climate variability affecting the quantity and seasonality of
	primary productivity; (3) bottom-up vs. top-down forcing. These proposed
	mechanisms provide a framework for comparisons of ecosystem function
	among oceanic regions (or regimes) and are essential in modeling
	ecosystem response to climate change, as well as for creating dynamic
	ecosystem-based marine conservation strategies. (C) 2009 Elsevier

  abstract = {Successful management of fishery resources is dependent on understanding
	the exploited species' reproductive potential, which, in turn, requires
	spatially relevant estimates of the size at maturity and the size-fecundity
	relationship. This information is used by fisheries managers to implement
	regional maturity based legal landings sizes and seasonal fishery
	closures aimed at protecting the spawning stock and maintaining the
	reproductive output of the Fished population at a sustainable level,
	despite exploitation. Crab fisheries in particular depend on such
	information, which is often limited, even in long-established fisheries.
	To address this Issue, size-fecundity relationships were obtained
	for two commercially exploited crabs in waters around the Shetland
	Islands (60 degrees N 01 degrees W). These species were Cancer pagurus
	and Necora puber. A statistically significant positive size-fecundlity
	relationship was found for C. pagurns which describes a mean reproduction
	potential ranging from similar to 0.78 million eggs in females of
	129 mm carapace width (CW) to similar to 2.4 million eggs in females
	of 212 mm CNV. The positive size-fecundity relationship found for
	C. puber was not statistically significant, but describes a mean
	reproduction potential ranging from similar to 0.16 million eggs
	in females of 56 mm CW to similar to 0.19 million eggs in females
	of 96 rum CNV. Morphometric assessments of reproductive capacity
	in C. pagurus support the notion that positive size-fecundity relationships
	are attributable to the combined capacities of specific morphological
	features, each of which contributes to a female's spawning output
	ability. Statistically significant positive linear relationships
	were found between the natural logarithms of crab size (MV) and pleopod
	capacity, sperm plug mass, spermathecae capacity and gonad capacity.
	Respectively, these structures are crucial for successful egg attachment
	and incubation, sperm retention and protection, sperm storage and

	(SW Indian Ocean) in order to attract and catch small pelagic fish
	of economic importance for the local fishery. These artificial reefs
	also attract a high density of juvenile coral reef fish, especially
	after recruitment. Because of high species richness and density,
	a suitable method of evaluating diversity and abundance in such assemblages
	is needed. An experiment was conducted in situ for 1 year in order
	to test which of the two visual techniques, slate or video recording,
	would be the most suitable for sampling artificial reefs. For the
	quantitative study, a rope framework (four belt transects each measuring
	24×3 m) was used to ease the movement of the divers. To avoid bias
	due to time variations, the study was conducted under limited time
	in situ. The advantages and disadvantages of the two techniques regarding
	the accuracy of qualitative and quantitative results are discussed.
	The qualitative study results show that the slate technique is the
	most accurate one for determining species richness. In the quantitative
	study, factors such as species characteristics (ecological type),
	attractiveness (relationship between fish and diver) and abundance
	of fish communities around the artificial reefs appear to influence
	our results on the comparison of the two techniques. Of 13 ‘permanent’

	bengalensis, Priacanthus hamrur, Chaetodon kleinii, Heniochus diphreutes,
	Mulloides vanicolensis); these were then selected for comparison
	of the techniques using quantitative data. The correlation between
	video and slate census results is high, but, in comparison with the
	slate census, the video census underestimates abundance, especially
	for low values. A corrected index is proposed to remedy this underestimation;

  abstract = {Estimation of individual reproductive investment is central in many
	types of fish biology studies. Such work seeks to obtain quick and
	reliable reports on fecundity and maturity in fish with numerous
	eggs. Typically, fecundity has often been estimated using the gravimetric
	method, in which fecundity is the product of the number of oocytes
	per gram of ovary tissue (oocyte density) and the weight of the ovary
	in grams. This paper presents a method for estimating oocyte density
	using an image analysis system. The image analyser rapidly determines
	the average diameter;of vitellogenic (yolk, containing) oocytes in
	a sample, and then, the mean diameter is converted into oocyte density
	using a precise calibration curve. To establish the calibration curve
	pre-spawning ovaries from wild and laboratory-reared Northeast Arctic
	cod were sampled for gravimetric counting of vitellogenic oocyte
	density and mean vitellogenie oocyte diameter. The latter was measured
	by an image analysis system, while oocyte density was found by manual
	counting of pre-weighed subsamples. A power regression, where mean
	oocyte diameter (OD) was the independent variable and oocyte density
	(NG) was the dependent variable, explained 99% of the variation,
	measured as r(2). It was concluded that potential fecundity (F-p
	i.e. standing stock of vitellogenic oocytes in pre-spawning individuals)
	of cod could be estimated from total ovary weight (OW) and mean oocyte
	diameter using the formula: F-p = 2.139 X 10(11) X OD-2,700 (mum)
	X OW (g), 300 mum less than or equal to OD less than or equal to
	850 mum. It took approximately 5 min to measure mean oocyte diameters
	including the manual preparation of the sample for analysis and the
	data processing afterwards. Thus, this was a highly time-efficient
	system compared to previous protocols for potential fecundity estimation.
	We have named this procedure using an image analyser to estimate
	potential fecundity the auto-diametric fecundity method. Furthermore,
	the accurate and precise measurement of oocyte size is shown to have
	direct practical implications for the assessment of maturity stage
	and predictions of start of spawning. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	A buoyancy model was developed and showed that this difference was
	mainly caused by differences in egg water content which was 96.6+/-0.47%

	Arctic cod Gadus morhua the construction of fecundity models reflecting
	variation in the nutritional status of the fish was attempted. The
	models were based on fecundity time series covering 9 years within
	the period 1986-2004 and included both general and year-specific
	approaches. Initial data analysis revealed that the potential fecundity
	(F-P) (standing stock of vitellogenic oocytes) was significantly
	reduced as the vitellogenic oocytes increased in size towards the
	start of spawning. Histological examination strongly indicated that
	this seasonal reduction was caused by atresia. Regression analysis
	showed that the F-P was positively correlated to fish total length
	(L-T) and the Fulton's condition factor (K). A multiple regression
	including data for all years using fish L-T, K and mean oocyte diameter
	(D-O) as independent predictors described the F-P with an r(2) =
	0.94. This was considerably higher than comparable univariate L-T
	or mass-based regressions. These univariate regressions had fairly
	high r(2) values when split by years, but not as high as found for
	year-specific multiple regressions. An important application for
	individual-based fecundity models may be to generate outputs that
	can be fed into stock level fecundity and recruitment models. Overall,
	the multivariate models seemed to be the most accurate. The multivariate
	model including mean D-O, however, also had the potential to correct
	for maturity and thus provide unbiased fecundity comparisons between
	years, stocks and locations. (c) 2006 The Fisheries Society of the

	a clear pattern with fish maturing at a greater age and size in the
	north compared to the south. For three of the four cod stocks we
	demonstrated a significant reduction in relative potential fecundity
	as maturity progressed towards spawning, i.e., as the mean diameter
	of vitellogenic follicles increased. To be able to compare potential
	fecundity in a standardised way both in time and space, we constructed
	models that included mean diameter as one of the independent variables.
	Our potential fecundity comparisons clearly indicated a north-south

  abstract = {In a study of reproduction in male European eels <i>Anguilla anguilla</i>,
	we induced spermatogenesis through hormone injection and established
	a spermatogenic maturity index (SMI) as a novel quantification of
	testis development. Eels in the experiments were sacrificed weekly
	and testis tissue was sampled for histological analysis of spermatogenesis.
	Testis development was followed over 18 weeks, during which the males
	continued to develop spermatocytes and produce spermatozoa. The SMI
	describes testis development from estimation of the area fractions
	of various tissue categories characterized by progressive gamete
	development stages in histological sections of the testes. The index
	weighs the volume fractions of the different tissues (somatic cells
	and germ cell stages) and describes development on a scale of 0 to
	1. The method improves the existing histological classification,
	providing a quantitative measure that reflects the spermatogenic
	process and can be correlated with morphological and physiological
	parameters. In this study, the SMI reacted immediately to the onset
	of spermatogenesis and increased linearly over time, tracking the
	development of spermatocysts and spermatozoa. In week 7, the SMI
	reached a stable level of around 0.75, where it remained, with limited
	fluctuations, until the end of the experiment. This reflected the
	composition of different germ cell stages in the testis tissue with
	a continuous generation of spermatocysts and production of spermatozoa.
	In comparison, the gonadosomatic index showed a delayed response
	to the onset of spermatogenesis and fluctuated substantially during
	the sperm production period. The properties of the SMI made it a
	useful index for describing spermatogenesis in male European eels
	during this experiment and a promising tool for quantifying testis
	development and describing male reproductive strategy in other fish
	species.},

	index supported stage definitions. but substantial variation in Fulton's

	In synchronous spawners, the weight of the gonad may represent as
	much as 40% of the overall body weight of the fish. In asynchronous
	spawners, the weight of the mature ovary is considerably less than
	in synchronous ovulators, but the ovary shows a more regular periodicity
	and may grow repeatedly many times during the breeding season. There
	is a huge variability in egg size in teleosts, with the largest known
	measuring up to 8 cm in diameter. Within the limits of variance set
	by genetic constraints, egg size may vary between populations of
	the same species. Oocytes in all teleosts undergo the same basic
	pattern of growth: oogenesis, primary oocyte growth, cortical alveolus
	stage, vitellogenesis, maturation and ovulation. The mechanisms that
	control oocyte growth are addressed in this review, albeit that the
	available information, as in all other vertebrates, is very limited.
	The main hormones that have been shown to affect ovarian growth are
	gonadotrophin, thyroid hormones, growth th hormone, insulin and insulin-like
	growth factors. An overview of the determinants of fecundity, with
	particular reference to oocyte recruitment and atresia, is the focus
	of the second part of the paper. Genetics and nutrition have major
	effects on fecundity, and studies so far suggest that the determinants
	of fecundity usually operate during the early part of gametogenesis.
	The role of atresia in determining fecundity is less clear. The final

	depending on ecological context and life history situation. In Norwegian
	spring spawning herring (NSS-herring) (Clupea harengus) different
	trade-offs during the seasons of feeding, overwintering, migration
	and spawning are likely to influence school morphology and behaviour.
	in the field, hydro acoustics are able to record collective patterns,
	but hardly the mechanisms of how individual decisions and interactions
	lead to the observed formations. Individual based models (IBMs) on
	the other hand, are promising simulation tools for investigating
	how low-level individual behaviour influences large-scale behaviour.
	We have used this approach with a rule based school model in order
	to gain understanding of how certain school patterns can emerge during
	the spawning of NSS-herring. Response to predation and motivation
	towards spawning are added to the response to nearby fish. Simply
	by varying population size and synchronisation of spawning motivation
	we find different system responses in terms of school morphology
	and dynamics. With high motivational synchronisation, the system
	is mainly represented by one integrated school, whereas low degree
	of synchronisation presents a system with frequent split-offs of
	small schools. An intermediate degree of synchronisation leads to
	a more complex situation with schools or layers in a dynamic vertical
	contact and formation of vertical 'hourglasses' or cylindrical shaped
	schools. This suggests that the degree of motivational synchronisation
	between individuals in a school will determine whether or to what
	degree a school splits into different components or remains integrated.
	We also find that with increasing population size there are new system
	behaviours emerging, not present with lower population size. Larger
	populations lead to horizontal extension of the pre-spawning components
	resulting in a double layer system where vertical bridges connecting
	the two layers are established. The cylindrical bridges are truly
	emergent properties of the system, formed and maintained by ovulating
	and spent herring moving across these structures. Similar school
	formations with vertical connections have been observed acoustically

	The locations of captures were from the mouth of the Klamath River
	upstream to river kilometer 72. A total of 82 females and H 8 males
	were sampled for age, sex, body size, gonad weight, fecundity, egg
	size, and gonadal histology during April-July for five consecutive
	years (1999-2003). All fish sampled were considered mature adults,
	except for two immature males (body weight, 10 and 16 kg) captured
	close to the mouth of the river. The average body weight for males
	and females was 32 and 46 kg, respectively. The condition factor
	ranged from 0.60 to 0.92 for males and from 0.65 to 0.94 for females.
	The long tapered body conformation for both sexes made it difficult
	to sex individuals by external morphology, but in general, the females
	had a slightly more robust conformation. The fork length range was
	139-199 cm in males and 151-223 cm in females. The majority (>90%)
	of males were 15-28 years old, and females were 19-34 years old.
	In all females the preovulatory condition was distinguished by the
	migration of the germinal vesicle to the animal pole, and the mean
	polarization index (distance of the germinal vesicle from the animal
	pole divided by oocyte diameter) was 0.042. The gonadosomatic index
	for females ranged from 7% to 17% and that for males from 2% to 8%.
	Individual and relative fecundity ranges were 59,000-242,000 and
	2,000-4,000 eggs, respectively. The fully grown eggs were the largest
	recorded for North American sturgeon, averaging 4.33 mm in diameter.
	Although this study indicates that the Klamath River supports an
	important and potentially stable spawning migration, continued monitoring
	of the population and identification of spawning and nursery sites
	are critical for the long-term preservation of this species.},

	living in groups. Initial phase (IP) females and territorial TP males
	(spawning daily) showed the lowest growth rates. Growth rate of territorial
	males was negatively correlated with their average spawning rate.
	All adult categories showed seasonal variations in growth, the highest
	rates occurring in the warmest season (August to October). A possible
	effect of depth on growth is confounded by differences in social
	and reproductive status. Growth of group TP males showed a weak positive
	correlation with their condition. Gross growth efficiencies were
	estimated by combining data on growth and body composition with previously
	published data on food intake and assimilation. Growth efficiency
	is highest for protein, ranging from 50.6% of food intake for juveniles

	A. iberus is a multiple spawner that releases batches of eggs between

	Despite this continuous release of eggs two moments appeared to stand

	with important fitness consequences. Capital breeders produce offspring
	from stored resources and, by decoupling feeding and reproduction,
	may bend the constraints caused by seasonality in food or predation.
	Income breeders, on the other hand, produce offspring from concurrent
	food intake, with the disadvantage of less flexibility, but with
	high efficiency and no inventory costs of carrying stores. Here,
	we assess relative profitability of capital and income breeding in
	herbivorous zooplankton inhabiting seasonal, high-latitude environments.
	We apply a state-dependent life history model where reproductive
	values are used to optimise energy allocation and diapause strategies
	over the year. Three environmental scenarios were modelled: an early,
	an intermediate, and a late feeding season. We found that capital
	breeding was most important in the early season. Capital breeding
	ranged from 7-9% of the eggs produced but, because of the high reproductive
	value of early eggs, capital breeding ranged from 9-30% when measured
	in terms of reproductive value. The main benefit of capital breeding
	was reproduction prior to the feeding season - when the reproductive
	value of an egg peaked. In addition, capital breeding was also used
	to increase egg production rates at times of income breeding. For
	individuals born late in the season the model predicted a two-year
	cycle instead of the typical annual life cycle. These individuals
	could then reap the benefits of early reproduction and capital breeding
	in their second year instead of income breeding late in the first
	year. We emphasize the importance of evaluating reproductive strategies
	such as capital and income breeding from a complete life cycle perspective.
	In particular, knowing the seasonality in offspring fitness is essential
	to appreciate evolutionary and population-level consequences of capital
	breeding.},

	OSRs resulted in more female-female meetings. As well, females were

	pregnancies were shorter, because of higher water temperatures, so

	(Scomber scombrus L.) has a determinate fecundity, that is, the number
	of oocytes destined to be matured in a season is decided prior to
	spawning and can be identified and counted before release of the
	first egg batch. This assumption has been questioned in recent years
	and the possibility of a serious miscalculation of fecundity has
	been raised. Evidence presented here shows that: A hiatus does not
	develop in the size frequency distribution between the previtellogenic
	and vitellogenic oocytes prior to spawning. The number of vitellogenic
	oocytes (potential annual fecundity) declines during spawning. The
	agreement between the potential annual fecundity measured prior to
	spawning and the number of eggs shed during spawning calculated by
	estimating the size and frequency of egg batches and the duration
	of the spawning season is somewhat ambiguous. The production of previtellogenic
	oocytes which replaces the potential annual fecundity occurs during
	spawning and over a short time period and not over an extended time
	period as is the case in fish with an indeterminate fecundity. Vitellogenic
	oocytes take about 140-154 days to grow to full size. As the best
	estimates for the length of the spawning season is 60-90 days it
	is unlikely that there would be sufficient time for any new vitellogenic
	oocytes to mature. The prevalence of atresia in the population varies
	between 26 and 50 % and the mean relative intensity between 4 and
	12 % during the spawning season. The effect of these levels of atresia
	on the potential annual fecundity is to reduce it by 6-13 % depending
	upon assumptions of the likely duration of alpha atretic oocytes
	in the ovary. Maximum levels of atresia occur three quarters of the
	way through spawning and subsequently decline. This strategy would
	seem to be more characteristic of a fish with a determinate fecundity.
	Fish with an indeterminate fecundity would be expected to produce
	vitellogenic oocytes during spawning and accumulate large numbers
	of atretic oocytes at the end of the spawning season because there
	was insufficient time for them to mature. It is concluded that for
	all practical purposes the mackerel should be considered as having
	a determinate fecundity.},

	During gonadotropin-independent primary growth, multiple nucleoli
	form as well as a Balbiani body which eventually disperses throughout
	the ooplasm. The first gonadotropin-dependent stage involves the
	formation of yolk vesicles, the precursors to the cortical alveoli.
	True vitellogenesis follows during which vitellogenin is sequestered
	from the maternal blood and packaged into yolk granules or spheres.
	The latter generally fuse centripetally at some time during oocyte
	growth to give a continuous fluid phase surrounded by a peripheral
	layer of cytoplasm containing the cortical alveoli. Maturation represents
	the final stage and is accompanied in many teleosts by water uptake;
	among marine teleosts with pelagic eggs, most of the final egg volume
	may be achieved by this process. Ovaries may be synchronous, asynchronous,
	or group-synchronous. Among the latter, a clutch of oocytes may be
	recruited from an asynchronous population of earlier stages into
	any of the subsequent stages. In teleosts which spawn repeatedly,
	recruitment of new clutches can usually be associated with the transition
	of a previously recruited clutch from one stage to the next. Teleosts
	thus offer examples of virtually every conceivable type of ovarian
	physiology and provide a wealth of experimental material for exploring
	the cellular and hormonal mechanisms which regulate oocyte recruitment
	and growth throughout ovarian recrudescence.},

	Trinidadian killifish, Rivulus hartii, inhabit communities with and

	decline and growth rates increase when guppies are present. Prior

	natural differences in growth. Many locality x food interactions
	were significant, often reversing the relationship between communities.
	Such interactions imply that there are fitness trade-offs associated

	Rivulus from localities with guppies matured earlier, produced many

	Sex ratio of P. anomala was skewed toward females during the spawning

	in early winter (December). The hepatosomatic index increased during
	late winter (February), peaked in May prior to peak spawning in June-August
	and decreased to its lowest value immediately after spawning. The
	patterns indicate that P. anomala reduced feeding activity and used
	reserved energy in muscle and liver for spawning. The fecundity of
	P. anomala ranged from 43 to 155 thousand eggs, with a mean of 80
	thousand eggs. Batch fecundity ranged from 25 to 62 thousand eggs,

	of 15 females, captive for 12 or more days, spawned multiple clutches.
	Spawning of multiple clutches was related to group synchronous cycles
	of oocyte development. Vitellogenic follicles were recruited from
	nonvitellogenic oocytes during the spawning season. Batch fecundity
	estimates of wild-caught females were not equivalent to daily spawns
	of caged females. Spawning on successive days was observed frequently;
	spawning of a batch (clutch) of ova was protracted. Batch fecundity
	was directly correlated with stream temperature at temperatures below
	21.5 C but not related to temperature at temperatures exceeding 21.5
	C. Spawning was negatively influenced by high discharge and by stream
	temperatures in excess of ca 21.5 C, the apparent thermal maximum.

  pages = {1227-1250},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {The freshwater fish assemblage in most estuaries is not as species
	rich as the marine assemblage in the same systems. Coupled with this
	differential richness is an apparent inability by most freshwater
	fish species to penetrate estuarine zones that are mesohaline (salinity:
	5·0–17·9), polyhaline (salinity: 18·0–29·9) or euhaline (salinity:
	30·0–39·9). The reason why mesohaline waters are avoided by most
	freshwater fishes is difficult to explain from a physiological perspective
	as many of these species would be isosmotic within this salinity
	range. Perhaps, a key to the poor penetration of estuarine waters
	by freshwater taxa is an inability to develop chloride cells in gill
	filament epithelia, as well as a lack of other osmoregulatory adaptations
	present in euryhaline fishes. Only a few freshwater fish species,
	especially some of those belonging to the family Cichlidae, have
	become fully euryhaline and have successfully occupied a wide range
	of estuaries, sometimes even dominating in hyperhaline systems (salinity
	40+). Indeed, this review found that there are few fish species that
	can be termed holohaline (i.e. capable of occupying waters with a
	salinity range of 0–100+) and, of these taxa, there is a disproportionally
	high number of freshwater species (e.g. Cyprinodon variegatus, Oreochromis
	mossambicus and Sarotherodon melanotheron). Factors such as increased
	competition for food and higher predation rates by piscivorous fishes
	and birds may also play an important role in the low species richness
	and abundance of freshwater taxa in estuaries. Added to this is the
	relatively low species richness of freshwater fishes in river catchments
	when compared with the normally higher diversity of marine fish species
	for potential estuarine colonization from the adjacent coastal waters.
	The almost complete absence of freshwater fish larvae from the estuarine
	ichthyoplankton further reinforces the poor representation of this
	guild within these systems. An explanation as to why more freshwater
	fish species have not become euryhaline and occupied a wide range
	of estuaries similar to their marine counterparts is probably due
	to a combination of the above described factors, with physiological
	restrictions pertaining to limited salinity tolerances probably playing
	the most important role.},

	require information on species life history and relative abundance,
	so we explored a scenario in which unbiased knowledge was used in
	the control rule and one in which highly inflated estimates of stock
	biomass were used. Our analyses showed that no single control rule
	performed well across all scenarios, with those that performed well
	in the unbiased scenario performing poorly in the biased scenarios
	and vice versa. Only the most conservative data-poor control rules
	limited the probability of overfishing across most of the life history

	very conservative catches under the unbiased scenarios.},

	22:6(n-3) (docosahexaenoic acid, DHA). Oil consists of neutral lipids
	and is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Egg lipids are
	derived from dietary fatty acid, fatty acid mobilized from reserves
	and possibly fatty acid synthesized de novo. There is selective incorporation
	of essential fatty acids, particularly DHA, into yolk lipids and
	discrimination against incorporation of 22:l(n-11). Lipid is delivered
	to the oocyte by vitellogenin, which is rich in polar lipids, and
	likely also by other lipoproteins, especially very low density lipoprotein,
	which is rich in triacylglycerol (TAG). All classes of lipid may
	be used as fuel during embryonic and larval development and MUFA
	are preferred fatty acids for catabolism by embryos. Catabolism of
	ail globules is frequently delayed until latter stages of development.
	In some species, DHA derived from hydrolysis of phospholipid may
	be conserved by transfer to the neutral lipid. Recent work has expanded
	knowledge of the role of DHA in membrane structure, especially in
	neural tissue, and molecular species analysis has indicated that
	PE containing sn-1 oleic acid is a prime contributor to membrane
	fluidity. The results of this type of study provide an explanation
	for the selection pressures that influence yolk lipid composition.
	Future work ought to expand knowledge of specific roles of individual

	harvest to maintain a target biomass of female spawners (40% of the
	female biomass observed in the absence of fishing). This harvest
	calculation does not consider the male population level for a species.
	If natural mortality rates (M) differ between sexes and if females
	outlive males, then a reduction in males relative to females could
	diminish the reproductive potential of the stock. This problem was
	examined in the present study by estimating separate sex-specific
	M-values for the arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias in Alaska,
	where females are almost always found at higher proportions than
	males during trawl surveys. Age data indicated that females outlive
	males, and estimates of M ranged from 0.10 to 0.33 for females and
	front 0. 16 to 0.51 for males. Based on four estimation methods,
	male M was consistently higher than female M. Simulated harvest scenarios
	in which male M and selectivity were varied indicated that increasing
	male M and lowering the age of males at first capture skewed the
	sex ratio even more toward females; in the most extreme harvest scenario,
	the percentage of females in the population was as high as 89% (Gulf
	of Alaska) and 96% (Bering Sea). Because reproductive success under
	a skewed sex ratio is probably linked to reproductive behavior, we
	developed a simple conceptual model to consider three reproductive
	strategies that differed in the number of females (1-3) that could
	be paired with a single male. Although a population's reproductive
	potential was much more resilient to changes in sex ratio for 1:2
	or 1:3 (male: female) pairings (reduced by only 15% when the population
	was 70% female), the fishing mortality rate (F) that corresponded
	to a reduction in egg fertilization was much higher than the target
	F (i.e., that maintained biomass at 40% of the unfished biomass)
	and exceeded overfishing levels when the population was over 80%

  abstract = {A new individual entering a population may be said to have a reproductive
	probability distribution. The reproductive probability is zero from
	zygote to reproductive maturity. Later, perhaps shortly after maturity,
	it reaches a peak value. Then it declines due to the cumulative probability
	of death. There is a cumulative probability of death with or without
	senescence. The selective value of a gene depends on how it affects
	the total reproductive probability. Selection of a gene that confers
	an advantage at one age and a disadvantage at another will depend
	not only on the magnitudes of the effects themselves, but also on
	the times of the effects. An advantage during the period of maximum
	reproductive probability would increase the total reproductive probability
	more than a proportionately similar disadvantage later on would decrease
	it. So natural selection will frequently maximize vigor in youth
	at the expense of vigor later on and thereby produce a declining
	vigor (senescence) during adult life. Selection, of course, will
	act to minimize the rate of this decline whenever possible. The rate
	of senescence shown by any species will reflect the balance between
	this direct, adverse selection of senescence as an unfavorable character,
	and the indirect, favorable selection through the age-related bias
	in the selection of pleiotropic genes. Variations in the amount of
	fecundity increase after maturity, in the adult mortality rate, and
	in other life-history features would affect the shape of the reproductive
	probability distribution and thereby influence the evolution of senescence.
	Any factor that decreases the rate of decline in reproductive probability
	intensifies selection against senescence. Any factor that increases
	the rate of this decline causes a relaxed selection against senescence
	and a greater advantage in increasing youthful vigor at the price
	of vigor later on. These considerations explain much of what is known
	of phylogenetic variation in rates of senescence. Other deductions
	from the theory are also supported by limited available evidence.
	These include the expectation that rapid morphogenesis should be
	associated with rapid senescence, that senescence should always be
	a generalized deterioration of many organs and systems, and that
	post-reproductive periods be short and infrequent in any wild population.},

	(2006-2010), richness of 'exploited' species increased within marine
	reserves, but remained unchanged in areas open to fishing. Further,
	analysis of differences in community structure in this time period
	(2006-2010) indicate that both 'exploited' and 'non-target' groups
	were more stable within marine reserves than were those within fished
	areas. Consequentially average trophic level of the community remained
	stable within marine reserves but declined sharply in areas open
	to fishing, indicating both declines in large omnivorous species
	and increases in forage fish within exploited regions. These analyses
	offer an important test of the direct and indirect effects of marine

  abstract = {Changes in the morphology of the ovary are described during maturation
	and it is established that it is a homogeneous structure for sampling
	purposes at maturity stages four and five. Several aspects of vitellogenic
	oocyte growth and recruitement were examined as criteria to ascertain
	whether the annual fecundity can be determined in Solea solea just
	prior to spawning. The first criterion was whether a hiatus develops
	in the size frequency distribution between the previtellogenic and
	vitellogenic oocytes just prior to spawning. We were unable to demonstrate
	this feature in sole from division VIId (N = 5) or IVc (N = 5) but
	it was present in two out of five fish from division Vile and all
	fish examined from division VIIa (N = 5) and IVb west (N = 5). The
	hiates occurred between 175 and 250 mu m (cohort size 25 mu m) in
	the size frequency distribution and measured between 25 and 75 mu
	m. Oocyte size frequency distribution from mid spawning and late
	spawning-spent sole from division IVc showed a hiatus in 9 out of
	10 fish which became wider as the residual annual potential fecundity
	declined. Next the rate of recruitment and growth of vitellogenic
	oocytes was studied in sole sampled at monthly intervals (July 1993
	to February 1994) from division VIId in relation to the start and
	duration of the annual spawning season. The growth rate of the leading
	oocyte cohort was 2.73 x 10(-5) mm(3) per day on 20 September and
	increased to 3.91 x 10(-3) at a mean diameter of 839 mu m by 10 February
	just prior to spawning. However, the observed maximum growth rate,
	even when adjusted for the positive influence of temperature, allowed
	little scope for previtellogenic oocytes to complete maturation during
	a spawning period of 60 days. The recruitment of viltellogenic oocytes
	was 3013 oocytes per day on 3 August and declined rapidly as spawning
	approached. In the three months prior to spawning no significant
	increase was found in the annual potential fecundity. An analysis
	of a sample of spawning fish from IVc demonstrated that 88% had less
	than 50% of their predicted potential fecundity remaining in the
	ovary. The mean batch fecundity was 8400 (SE +/- 13363) and in conjunction
	with existing data on spawning frequency and duration gave a realised
	fecundity close to the potential fecundity. It is concluded that
	for all practical purposes the sole can be regarded as having a determinate
	fecundity in all the areas studied. The regulation of potential fecundity
	by follicular atresia was assessed in pre-spawning and spawning sole.
	In ICES areas IV and VII the prevalence of atretic oocytes in pre-spawning
	fish varied between 0.04 and 0.69 and the relative intensity varied
	between 0.017 and 0.076. During spawning in division IVc the prevalence
	of atresia varied between 0.45 and 0.57 and the relative intensity
	between 0.022 and 0.058. If we assume a turnover rate of 9 days the
	loss from the potential annual fecundity, during spawning, in division
	IVc would be 12.4%.},

	However, applications of this approach have considered maturation
	state in relation to fish size long after the period when fish make
	the 'decision' to mature. Evidence, mostly from salmonids, indicates
	that maturation is controlled by successive hormonal inhibition linked
	to energy state during critical periods of the year. Thus, any genetic
	selection cannot be acting upon the size of fish late in the reproductive
	cycle, but rather during the timing of these critical periods. Indeed,
	experimental studies demonstrate that size attained by late stages
	of gametogenesis need not necessarily be a good predictor of the
	probability of maturing. Therefore, changes in energy status around
	the time of maturation decisions represent an unknown and possibly
	significant source of variability in the reaction norm midpoints.
	Clearly, there is a need to apply physiologically realistic models
	of maturation probability - as have been developed for Atlantic salmon
	- to other fish species. Future investigation of fisheries -induced
	evolution may also benefit from examining historical changes in fecundity

	2. This study examined the relationship between maternal age, spawning
	time and early survivorship in the North Sea haddock stock. Temporal
	changes in egg production were compared with the birth date distribution
	of progeny surviving to the demersal phase in 1994, 1996 and 1999,
	when the age structure of the spawning stock differed.
	
	3. Estimates of intra-annual variation in stock egg production indicated
	that first-time spawning 2-year-olds began spawning much later than
	older age-classes.
	
	4. The form and magnitude of selection on birth date varied between
	years, indicating that the production of multiple batches of eggs
	over an extended period has some adaptive significance to progeny
	survival.
	
	5. Survivorship was consistently poor from the late spawning period
	when age 2 females contributed most to stock egg production. This
	persistent selection against late hatched offspring could reflect
	either low parental investment, as age 2 females produce smaller
	eggs, or the short length of the growing season prior to settlement.
	
	6. Variability in birth date selection, particularly with respect
	to first vs. subsequent years of spawning, implies a strong selection
	pressure for a long reproductive lifespan. As such, reproductive
	potential in this and other exploited fish species with a similar

	have proven useful for predicting reproductive potential of fishes.
	Such proxy measures are advantageous in that they are easier to measure
	directly than fecundity and can often be measured in advance of spawning.
	We explored the utility of simple as well as more detailed measures
	of reproductive output in a laboratory experiment with black sea
	bass (Centropristis striata), an iteroparous, batch spawning protogynous
	hermaphrodite that may exhibit both determinate and indeterminate
	fecundity patterns within its geographic range. Wild fish were collected
	in fall, well ahead of spring-summer spawning, from two locations
	(Woods Hole, MA; Panama City, FL) representing mid-Atlantic and Gulf
	of Mexico stocks. To obtain a range in condition, fish were subject
	to either a high or low feeding regime for 4–5 months. During the
	experiment, length, weight, and bioelectrical impedance analysis
	(BIA) of individuals were monitored monthly. At the end of the experiment,
	additional individual measures taken included: relative gonad, liver,
	and viscera weights, absolute energy density, sex and maturity. As
	planned, these feeding treatments produced a range in sizes, fish
	of both sexes were developing or spawning capable, and the high ration
	group had higher Kn. This provided sufficient contrast to explore
	predictive relationships between total gonad energy (TGE) and terminal
	or prior biological measures. Examining multiple models with Akaike
	Information Criteria showed that final TGE was estimated with highest
	precision from a model including final sex, gonadosomatic index,
	length, Kn and liver energy density (89.1% deviance explained). The
	best model using nonlethal measures included BIA measured phase angle
	(PA) one month earlier, but much precision was lost (31.0% deviance
	explained). The explanatory power of PA, Kn, fish size, and stock
	also changed during the experiment, reflecting differences in the
	timing and magnitude of energy allocation and the difficulty in applying
	non-lethal measures to estimate TGE precisely in this species. Different
	energy allocation pathways were also apparent by stock. By the end
	of the experiment, mid-Atlantic black sea bass allocated more energy
	to liver and gonad whereas Gulf black sea bass allocated more energy
	to soma and viscera. We postulate that such intraspecific differences
	are adaptive in terms of the very different environmental conditions
	experienced by and the reported differences in spawning strategies
	by each stock, but this is rarely demonstrated in fishes and warrants
	further investigation.},

	Consideration of the trade-off between offspring size and number

	offspring size is larger when developmental time is longer (e.g.,
	at lower temperatures). Earlier start of reproduction at higher temperature
	shortens the exposure of organisms to mortality factors. Then, a
	reduction in mortality will have a smaller effect on survival to
	reproduction and, thus, a smaller effect on fitness. In addition,
	the offspring produced earlier have a higher reproductive value.
	Thus, a reduction in clutch size, which allows a female to produce
	larger offspring, is both more costly and less rewarding at high
	temperature. We found the optimal size at birth for semelparic reproduction.
	For iteroparic reproduction we consider two numerical examples: an
	artificial data set and real data on obligate asexual and cyclic
	parthenogenetic clones of Daphnia. Both examples support the prediction
	that at moderate mortalities the ''many small offspring'' strategy

	dominance declined with time. This may be result of a decline in
	the abundance of dominant species or an increase in the abundance

	from the percent of females with migratory nucleus and mature stage

  abstract = {Atresia in the ovaries of sardine Sardina pilchardus did not show
	clear seaonal patterns. There was high prevalance (c. 60%) and low
	intensity (c. 1% of gonadal area occupied by oocytes) in all months
	of the spawning season studied. The batch size to ovary-free mass
	relationship was significantly different in the mid-spawning season,
	with higher relative fecundity and gonadosomatic index (I,) in January
	than in November and March. There was no additional effect on batch
	fecundity due to age or condition factor. Data from monthly market
	samples during 1998-1999 revealed a continuous decline of the condition
	Factor throughout the spawning season. The market samples also revealed
	that the duration of the spawning season is not equal fur all fish.
	In any month, pre-spawning fish tended to have significantly higher
	I, than spawners, indicating that delayed initiation uf spawning
	can lead to larger relative Fecundity. The increase in sardine relative
	fecundity during the first half of the spawning season is probably
	due to the continuous influx of new spawners and possibly to body
	mass loss that is initially not translated into gonad mass loss.
	After January when all visible fat reverses within the body cavity
	have disappeared. the influx of new spawners practically ceases.},
