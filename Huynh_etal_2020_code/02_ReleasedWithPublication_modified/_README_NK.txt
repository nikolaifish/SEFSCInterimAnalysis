This folder contains the code originally provided by Huynh et al 2020 with their manuscript, but slightly modified by me. The code did not run correctly, partly due to errors I contacted the authors about.

The folder also contains a script I wrote (Huynh 2020 IA code.Rmd) to plot the results they posted in the rds files in the MSE_obj folder. I was able to plot values from the rds files to create plots that (exactly?) match the plots they produced in their paper. This is important confirmation that we know how their results files relate to their paper.
