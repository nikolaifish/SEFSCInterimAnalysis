The files in the MSE_obj were produced from me running the run_script on my computer, though they were produced discontinuously since it takes days to run.

This folder contains the code that was corrected by the Huynh et al 2020, to fix some bugs I had found. Still, I found another important error that I corrected in the run_script.R. I fixed this error and was able to run the code successfully (though it takes about 3 days to run it all).

Rerunning "Huynh 2020 IA code.Rmd" I was able to plot values from the rds files to create plots that match the plots they produced in their paper. There are slight differences in the plots, likely due to the stochastic nature of the simulations. This is important confirmation that we know that the code provided is the correct code to produce the results from their paper.
